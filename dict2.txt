DOWN
THE
RABBIT
HOLE
was
beginning
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
bank
and
having
nothing
do
once
or
twice
she
had
peeped
into
book
reading
but
it
no
pictures
conversations
what
is
use
a
thought
without
conversation
So
considering
own
mind
as
well
could
for
hot
day
made
feel
sleepy
stupid
whether
pleasure
making
daisy
chain
would
be
worth
trouble
getting
up
picking
daisies
when
suddenly
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
There
so
VERY
remarkable
that
nor
did
think
much
out

hear
say
itself
Oh
