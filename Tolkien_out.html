<br>FOREWORD
<br>   
<br>   This tale grew in <b>the</b> telling, until <b>it</b> became a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> included many glimpses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yet more ancient history that preceded <b>it</b>. It was begun soon after The Hobbit was written <b>and</b> before its publication in 1937; <b>but</b> I did not go <b>on</b> with this sequel, for I wished first <b>to</b> complete <b>and</b> set in order <b>the</b> mythology <b>and</b> legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired <b>to</b> do this for my own satisfaction, <b>and</b> I had little hope that other people would be interested in this work, especially since <b>it</b> was primarily linguistic in inspiration <b>and</b> was begun in order <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> necessary background <b>of</b> “history” for Elvish tongues.
<br>   When those whose advice <b>and</b> opinion I sought corrected little hope <b>to</b> <b>no</b> hope, I went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sequel, encouraged <b>by</b> requests from readers for more information concerning hobbits <b>and</b> their adventures. But <b>the</b> story was drawn irresistibly towards <b>the</b> older world, <b>and</b> became an account, as <b>it</b> were, <b>of</b> its end <b>and</b> passing away before its beginning <b>and</b> middle had been told. The process had begun in <b>the</b> writing <b>of</b> The Hobbit, in which there were already some references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, <b>the</b> High-elves, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden <b>of</b> things higher <b>or</b> deeper <b>or</b> darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, <b>the</b> Necromancer, <b>the</b> Ring. The discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> these glimpses <b>and</b> <b>of</b> their relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ancient histories revealed <b>the</b> Third Age <b>and</b> its culmination in <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring.
<br>   Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> they had <b>to</b> wait a long time; for <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings went <b>on</b> at intervals during <b>the</b> years 1936 <b>to</b> 1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect, <b>and</b> many other interests as a learner <b>and</b> teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, <b>of</b> course, also increased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> outbreak <b>of</b> war in 1939, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> which year <b>the</b> tale had not yet reached <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Book One. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next five years I found that <b>the</b> story could not now be wholly abandoned, <b>and</b> I plodded <b>on</b>, mostly <b>by</b> night, till I stood <b>by</b> Balin's tomb in Moria. There I halted for a long while. It was almost a year later when I went <b>on</b> <b>and</b> so came <b>to</b> Lothl?rien <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great River late in 1941. In <b>the</b> next year I wrote <b>the</b> first drafts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter that now stands as Book Three, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beginnings <b>of</b> chapters I <b>and</b> III <b>of</b> Book Five; <b>and</b> there as <b>the</b> beacons flared in An?rien <b>and</b> Th?oden came <b>to</b> Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had failed <b>and</b> there was <b>no</b> time for thought.
<br>   It was during 1944 that, leaving <b>the</b> loose ends <b>and</b> perplexities <b>of</b> a war which <b>it</b> was my task <b>to</b> conduct, <b>or</b> at least <b>to</b> report, I forced myself <b>to</b> tackle <b>the</b> journey <b>of</b> Frodo <b>to</b> Mordor. These chapters, eventually <b>to</b> become Book Four, were written <b>and</b> sent out as a serial <b>to</b> my son, Christopher, then in South Africa with <b>the</b> RAF. Nonetheless <b>it</b> took another five years before <b>the</b> tale was brought <b>to</b> its present end; in that time I changed my house, my chair, <b>and</b> my college, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> days though less dark were <b>no</b> less laborious. Then when <b>the</b> “end” had at last been reached <b>the</b> whole story had <b>to</b> be revised, <b>and</b> indeed largely re-written backwards. And <b>it</b> had <b>to</b> be typed, <b>and</b> re-typed: <b>by</b> me; <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> professional typing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ten-fingered was beyond my means.
<br>   The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings has been read <b>by</b> many people since <b>it</b> finally appeared in print; <b>and</b> I should like <b>to</b> say something here with reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> many opinions <b>or</b> guesses that I have received <b>or</b> have read concerning <b>the</b> motives <b>and</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale. The prime motive was <b>the</b> desire <b>of</b> a tale-teller <b>to</b> try his hand at a really long story that would hold <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> readers, amuse them, delight them, <b>and</b> at times maybe excite them <b>or</b> deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing <b>or</b> moving, <b>and</b> for many <b>the</b> guide was inevitably often at fault. Some who have read <b>the</b> book, <b>or</b> at any rate have reviewed <b>it</b>, have found <b>it</b> boring, absurd, <b>or</b> contemptible; <b>and</b> I have <b>no</b> cause <b>to</b> complain, since I have similar opinions <b>of</b> their works, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> writing that they evidently prefer. But even from <b>the</b> points <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails <b>to</b> please. It is perhaps not possible in a long tale <b>to</b> please everybody at all points, nor <b>to</b> displease everybody at <b>the</b> same points; for I find from <b>the</b> letters that I have received that <b>the</b> passages <b>or</b> chapters that are <b>to</b> some a blemish are all <b>by</b> others specially approved. The most critical reader <b>of</b> all, myself, now finds many defects, minor <b>and</b> major, <b>but</b> being fortunately under <b>no</b> obligation either <b>to</b> review <b>the</b> book <b>or</b> <b>to</b> write <b>it</b> again, he will pass over these in silence, except one that has been noted <b>by</b> others: <b>the</b> book is too short.
<br>   As for any inner meaning <b>or</b> “message”, <b>it</b> has in <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As <b>the</b> story grew <b>it</b> put down roots (<b>into</b> <b>the</b> past) <b>and</b> threw out unexpected branches: <b>but</b> its main theme was settled from <b>the</b> outset <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inevitable choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring as <b>the</b> link between <b>it</b> <b>and</b> The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, “The Shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Past”, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale. It was written long before <b>the</b> foreshadow <b>of</b> 1939 had yet become a threat <b>of</b> inevitable disaster, <b>and</b> from that point <b>the</b> story would have developed along essentially <b>the</b> same lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, <b>or</b> in some cases already written, <b>and</b> little <b>or</b> nothing in <b>it</b> was modified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> war that began in 1939 <b>or</b> its sequels.
<br>   The real war does not resemble <b>the</b> legendary war in its process <b>or</b> its conclusion. If <b>it</b> had inspired <b>or</b> directed <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legend, then certainly <b>the</b> Ring would have been seized <b>and</b> used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated <b>but</b> enslaved, <b>and</b> Barad-d?r would not have been destroyed <b>but</b> occupied. Saruman, failing <b>to</b> get possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, would m <b>the</b> confusion <b>and</b> treacheries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time have found in Mordor <b>the</b> missing links in his own researches <b>into</b> Ring-lore, <b>and</b> before long he would have made a Great Ring <b>of</b> his own with which <b>to</b> challenge <b>the</b> self-styled Ruler <b>of</b> Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred <b>and</b> contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.
<br>   Other arrangements could be devised according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tastes <b>or</b> views <b>of</b> those who like allegory <b>or</b> topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, <b>and</b> always have done so since I grew old <b>and</b> wary enough <b>to</b> detect its presence. I much prefer history, true <b>or</b> feigned, with its varied applicability <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thought <b>and</b> experience <b>of</b> readers. I think that many confuse “applicability” with “allegory”; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> one resides in <b>the</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reader, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other in <b>the</b> purposed domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author.
<br>   An author cannot <b>of</b> course remain wholly unaffected <b>by</b> his experience, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> ways in which a story-germ uses <b>the</b> soil <b>of</b> experience are extremely complex, <b>and</b> attempts <b>to</b> define <b>the</b> process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate <b>and</b> ambiguous. It is also false, though naturally attractive, when <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> an author <b>and</b> critic have overlapped, <b>to</b> suppose that <b>the</b> movements <b>of</b> thought <b>or</b> <b>the</b> events <b>of</b> times common <b>to</b> both were necessarily <b>the</b> most powerful influences. One has indeed personally <b>to</b> come under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> war <b>to</b> feel fully its oppression; <b>but</b> as <b>the</b> years go <b>by</b> <b>it</b> seems now often forgotten that <b>to</b> be caught in youth <b>by</b> 1914 was <b>no</b> less hideous an experience than <b>to</b> be involved in 1939 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following years. By 1918 all <b>but</b> one <b>of</b> my close friends were dead. Or <b>to</b> take a less grievous matter: <b>it</b> has been supposed <b>by</b> some that “The Scouring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire” reflects <b>the</b> situation in England at <b>the</b> time when I was finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot, foreseen from <b>the</b> outset, though in <b>the</b> event modified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> Saruman as developed in <b>the</b> story without, need I say, any allegorical significance <b>or</b> contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed some basis in experience, though slender (for <b>the</b> economic situation was entirely different), <b>and</b> much further back. The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) <b>and</b> men were still building suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last decrepitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed <b>to</b> me so important. I never liked <b>the</b> looks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Young miller, <b>but</b> his father, <b>the</b> Old miller, had a black beard, <b>and</b> he was not named Sandyman.
<br>   The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings is now issued in a new edition, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opportunity has been taken <b>of</b> revising <b>it</b>. A number <b>of</b> errors <b>and</b> inconsistencies that still remained in <b>the</b> text have been corrected, <b>and</b> an attempt has been made <b>to</b> provide information <b>on</b> a few points which attentive readers have raised. I have considered all their comments <b>and</b> enquiries, <b>and</b> if some seem <b>to</b> have been passed over that may be because I have failed <b>to</b> keep my notes in order; <b>but</b> many enquiries could only be answered <b>by</b> additional appendices, <b>or</b> indeed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> an accessory volume containing much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material that I did not include in <b>the</b> original edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In <b>the</b> meantime this edition offers this Foreword, an addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prologue, some notes, <b>and</b> an index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> persons <b>and</b> places. This index is in intention complete in items <b>but</b> not in references, since for <b>the</b> present purpose <b>it</b> has been necessary <b>to</b> reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material prepared for me <b>by</b> Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accessory volume.

<br>PROLOGUE
<br>
<br>1. Concerning Hobbits
<br>   
<br>   This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, <b>and</b> from its pages a reader may discover much <b>of</b> their character <b>and</b> a little <b>of</b> their history. Further information will also be found in <b>the</b> selection from <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> Westmarch that has already been published, under <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> The Hobbit. That story was derived from <b>the</b> earlier chapters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book, composed <b>by</b> Bilbo himself, <b>the</b> first Hobbit <b>to</b> become famous in <b>the</b> world at large, <b>and</b> called <b>by</b> him There <b>and</b> Back Again, since they told <b>of</b> his journey <b>into</b> <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> his return: an adventure which later involved all <b>the</b> Hobbits in <b>the</b> great events <b>of</b> that Age that are here related.
<br>   Many, however, may wish <b>to</b> know more about this remarkable people from <b>the</b> outset, while some may not possess <b>the</b> earlier book. For such readers a few notes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first adventure is briefly recalled.
<br>   Hobbits are an unobtrusive <b>but</b> very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace <b>and</b> quiet <b>and</b> good tilled earth: a well-ordered <b>and</b> well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not <b>and</b> did not understand <b>or</b> like machines more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, <b>or</b> a hand-loom, though they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy <b>of</b> “<b>the</b> Big Folk”, as they call us, <b>and</b> now they avoid us with dismay <b>and</b> are becoming hard <b>to</b> find. They are quick <b>of</b> hearing <b>and</b> sharp-eyed, <b>and</b> though they are inclined <b>to</b> be fat <b>and</b> do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble <b>and</b> deft in their movements. They possessed from <b>the</b> first <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> disappearing swiftly <b>and</b> silently, when large folk whom they do not wish <b>to</b> meet come blundering <b>by</b>; <b>and</b> this an they have developed until <b>to</b> Men <b>it</b> may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic <b>of</b> any kind, <b>and</b> their elusiveness is due solely <b>to</b> a professional skill that heredity <b>and</b> practice, <b>and</b> a close friendship with <b>the</b> earth, have rendered inimitable <b>by</b> bigger <b>and</b> clumsier races.
<br>   For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout <b>and</b> stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height is variable, ranging between two <b>and</b> four feet <b>of</b> our measure. They seldom now reach three feet; <b>but</b> they hive dwindled, they say, <b>and</b> in ancient days they were taller. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son <b>of</b> Isengrim <b>the</b> Second, was four foot five <b>and</b> able <b>to</b> ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbit records only <b>by</b> two famous characters <b>of</b> old; <b>but</b> that curious matter is dealt with in this book.
<br>   As for <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> their peace <b>and</b> prosperity they were a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond <b>of</b> yellow <b>and</b> green; <b>but</b> they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles <b>and</b> were clad in a thick curling hair, much like <b>the</b> hair <b>of</b> their heads, which was commonly brown. Thus, <b>the</b> only craft little practised among them was shoe-making; <b>but</b> they had long <b>and</b> skilful fingers <b>and</b> could make many other useful <b>and</b> comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt <b>to</b> laughter, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> eating <b>and</b> drinking. And laugh they did, <b>and</b> eat, <b>and</b> drink, often <b>and</b> heartily, being fond <b>of</b> simple jests at all times, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable <b>and</b> delighted in parties, <b>and</b> in presents, which they gave away freely <b>and</b> eagerly accepted.
<br>   It is plain indeed that in spite <b>of</b> later estrangement Hobbits are relatives <b>of</b> ours: far nearer <b>to</b> us than Elves, <b>or</b> even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke <b>the</b> languages <b>of</b> Men, after their own fashion, <b>and</b> liked <b>and</b> disliked much <b>the</b> same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can <b>no</b> longer be discovered. The beginning <b>of</b> Hobbits lies far back in <b>the</b> Elder Days that are now lost <b>and</b> forgotten. Only <b>the</b> Elves still preserve any records <b>of</b> that vanished time, <b>and</b> their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom <b>and</b> Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet <b>it</b> is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk became even aware <b>of</b> them. And <b>the</b> world being after all full <b>of</b> strange creatures beyond count, these little people seemed <b>of</b> very little importance. But in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, <b>by</b> <b>no</b> wish <b>of</b> their own, both important <b>and</b> renowned, <b>and</b> troubled <b>the</b> counsels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great.
<br>   Those days, <b>the</b> Third Age <b>of</b> Middle-earth, are now long past, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> all lands has been changed; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless <b>the</b> same as those in which they still linger: <b>the</b> North-West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old World, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea. Of their original home <b>the</b> Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved <b>no</b> knowledge. A love <b>of</b> learning (other than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, <b>but</b> there remained still a few in <b>the</b> older families who studied their own books, <b>and</b> even gathered reports <b>of</b> old times <b>and</b> distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, <b>and</b> Men. Their own records began only after <b>the</b> settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> evidence <b>of</b> their peculiar words <b>and</b> customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in <b>the</b> distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem <b>to</b> glimpse a time when they dwelt in <b>the</b> upper vales <b>of</b> Anduin, between <b>the</b> eaves <b>of</b> Greenwood <b>the</b> Great <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook <b>the</b> hard <b>and</b> perilous crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains <b>into</b> Eriador is <b>no</b> longer certain. Their own accounts speak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multiplying <b>of</b> Men in <b>the</b> land, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> a shadow that fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forest, so that <b>it</b> became darkened <b>and</b> its new name was Mirkwood.
<br>   Before <b>the</b> crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains <b>the</b> Hobbits had already become divided <b>into</b> three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, <b>and</b> Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner <b>of</b> skin, smaller, <b>and</b> shorter, <b>and</b> they were beardless <b>and</b> bootless; their hands <b>and</b> feet were neat <b>and</b> nimble; <b>and</b> they preferred highlands <b>and</b> hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier in build; their feet <b>and</b> hands were larger, <b>and</b> they preferred flat lands <b>and</b> riversides. The Fallohides were fairer <b>of</b> skin <b>and</b> also <b>of</b> hair, <b>and</b> they were taller <b>and</b> slimmer than <b>the</b> others; they were lovers <b>of</b> trees <b>and</b> <b>of</b> woodlands.
<br>   The Harfoots had much <b>to</b> do with Dwarves in ancient times, <b>and</b> long lived in <b>the</b> foothills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. They moved westward early, <b>and</b> roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while <b>the</b> others were still in <b>the</b> Wilderland. They were <b>the</b> most normal <b>and</b> representative variety <b>of</b> Hobbit, <b>and</b> far <b>the</b> most numerous. They were <b>the</b> most inclined <b>to</b> settle in one place, <b>and</b> longest preserved their ancestral habit <b>of</b> living in tunnels <b>and</b> holes.
<br>   The Stoors lingered long <b>by</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River Anduin, <b>and</b> were less shy <b>of</b> Men. They came west after <b>the</b> Harfoots <b>and</b> followed <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loudwater southwards; <b>and</b> there many <b>of</b> them long dwelt between Tharbad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Dunland before they moved north again.
<br>   The Fallohides, <b>the</b> least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more friendly with Elves than <b>the</b> other Hobbits were, <b>and</b> had more skill in language <b>and</b> song than in handicrafts; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> old they preferred hunting <b>to</b> tilling. They crossed <b>the</b> mountains north <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>and</b> came down <b>the</b> River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with <b>the</b> other kinds that had preceded them, <b>but</b> being somewhat bolder <b>and</b> more adventurous, they were often found as leaders <b>or</b> chieftains among clans <b>of</b> Harfoots <b>or</b> Stoors. Even in Bilbo's time <b>the</b> strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among <b>the</b> greater families, such as <b>the</b> Tooks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Masters <b>of</b> Buckland.
<br>   In <b>the</b> westlands <b>of</b> Eriador, between <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Lune, <b>the</b> Hobbits found both Men <b>and</b> Elves. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain, <b>the</b> kings <b>of</b> Men that came over <b>the</b> Sea out <b>of</b> Westernesse; <b>but</b> they were dwindling fast <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lands <b>of</b> their North Kingdom were falling far <b>and</b> wide <b>into</b> waste. There was room <b>and</b> <b>to</b> spare for incomers, <b>and</b> ere long <b>the</b> Hobbits began <b>to</b> settle in ordered communities. Most <b>of</b> their earlier settlements had long disappeared <b>and</b> been forgotten in Bilbo's time; <b>but</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> become important still endured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> Chetwood that lay round about, some forty miles east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   It was in these early days, doubtless, that <b>the</b> Hobbits learned their letters <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> write after <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain, who had in their turn long before learned <b>the</b> art from <b>the</b> Elves. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, <b>and</b> spoke ever after <b>the</b> Common Speech, <b>the</b> Westron as <b>it</b> was named, that was current through all <b>the</b> lands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings from Arnor <b>to</b> Gondor, <b>and</b> about all <b>the</b> coasts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea from Belfalas <b>to</b> Lune. Yet they kept a few words <b>of</b> their own, as well as their own names <b>of</b> months <b>and</b> days, <b>and</b> a great store <b>of</b> personal names out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.
<br>   About this time legend among <b>the</b> Hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning <b>of</b> years. For <b>it</b> was in <b>the</b> one thousand six hundred <b>and</b> first year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age that <b>the</b> Fallohide brothers, Marcho <b>and</b> Blanco, set out from Bree; <b>and</b> having obtained permission from <b>the</b> high king at Fornost1, they crossed <b>the</b> brown river Baranduin with a great following <b>of</b> Hobbits. They passed over <b>the</b> Bridge <b>of</b> Stonebows, that had been built in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Kingdom, <b>and</b> they took ail <b>the</b> land beyond <b>to</b> dwell in, between <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Far Downs. All that was demanded <b>of</b> them was that they should keep <b>the</b> Great Bridge in repair, <b>and</b> all other bridges <b>and</b> roads, speed <b>the</b> king's messengers, <b>and</b> acknowledge his lordship.
<br>   Thus began <b>the</b> Shire-reckoning, for <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine (as <b>the</b> Hobbits turned <b>the</b> name) became Year One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> all later dates were reckoned from <b>it</b>.2 At once <b>the</b> western Hobbits fell in love with their new land, <b>and</b> they remained there, <b>and</b> soon passed once more out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Elves. While there was still a king they were in name his subjects, <b>but</b> they were, in fact, ruled <b>by</b> their own chieftains <b>and</b> meddled not at all with events in <b>the</b> world outside. To <b>the</b> last battle at Fornost with <b>the</b> Witch-lord <b>of</b> Angmar they sent some bowmen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king, <b>or</b> so they maintained, though <b>no</b> tales <b>of</b> Men record <b>it</b>. But in that war <b>the</b> North Kingdom ended; <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> Hobbits took <b>the</b> land for their own, <b>and</b> they chose from their own chiefs a Thain <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were little troubled <b>by</b> wars, <b>and</b> they prospered <b>and</b> multiplied after <b>the</b> Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until <b>the</b> disaster <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Long Winter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> famine that followed <b>it</b>. Many thousands then perished, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Days <b>of</b> Dearth (1158-60) were at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> this tale long past <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits had again become accustomed <b>to</b> plenty. The land was rich <b>and</b> kindly, <b>and</b> though <b>it</b> had long been deserted when they entered <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> had before been well tilled, <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, <b>and</b> woods.
<br>   Forty leagues <b>it</b> stretched from <b>the</b> Far Downs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge, <b>and</b> fifty from <b>the</b> northern moors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marshes in <b>the</b> south. The Hobbits named <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Shire, as <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> their Thain, <b>and</b> a district <b>of</b> well-ordered business; <b>and</b> there in that pleasant comer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world they plied their well-ordered business <b>of</b> living, <b>and</b> they heeded less <b>and</b> less <b>the</b> world outside where dark things moved, until they came <b>to</b> think that peace <b>and</b> plenty were <b>the</b> rule in Middle-earth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> all sensible folk. They forgot <b>or</b> ignored what little they had ever known <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guardians, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labours <b>of</b> those that made possible <b>the</b> long peace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, <b>but</b> they had ceased <b>to</b> remember <b>it</b>.
<br>   At <b>no</b> time had Hobbits <b>of</b> any kind been warlike, <b>and</b> they had never fought among themselves. In olden days they had, <b>of</b> course, been often obliged <b>to</b> fight <b>to</b> maintain themselves in a hard world; <b>but</b> in Bilbo's time that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, <b>and</b> indeed <b>the</b> only one that had ever been fought within <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, was beyond living memory: <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras Took routed an invasion <b>of</b> Orcs. Even <b>the</b> weathers had grown milder, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wolves that had once come ravening out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North in bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there was still some store <b>of</b> weapons in <b>the</b> Shire, these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths <b>or</b> <b>on</b> walls, <b>or</b> gathered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> museum at Michel Delving. The Mathom-house <b>it</b> was called; for anything that Hobbits had <b>no</b> immediate use for, <b>but</b> were unwilling <b>to</b> throw away, they called a mathom. Their dwellings were apt <b>to</b> become rather crowded with mathoms, <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presents that passed from hand <b>to</b> hand were <b>of</b> that sort.
<br>   Nonetheless, ease <b>and</b> peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, difficult <b>to</b> daunt <b>or</b> <b>to</b> kill; <b>and</b> they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond <b>of</b> good things not least because they could, when put <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, do without them, <b>and</b> could survive rough handling <b>by</b> grief, foe, <b>or</b> weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well <b>and</b> looked <b>no</b> further than their bellies <b>and</b> their well-fed faces. Though slow <b>to</b> quarrel, <b>and</b> for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, <b>and</b> at need could still handle arms. They shot well with <b>the</b> bow, for they were keen-eyed <b>and</b> sure at <b>the</b> mark. Not only with bows <b>and</b> arrows. If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, <b>it</b> was well <b>to</b> get quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.
<br>   All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in <b>the</b> ground, <b>or</b> so they believed, <b>and</b> in such dwellings they still felt most at home; <b>but</b> in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> time they had been obliged <b>to</b> adopt other forms <b>of</b> abode. Actually in <b>the</b> Shire in Bilbo's days <b>it</b> was, as a rule, only <b>the</b> richest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poorest Hobbits that maintained <b>the</b> old custom. The poorest went <b>on</b> living in burrows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window <b>or</b> none; while <b>the</b> well-<b>to</b>-do still constructed more luxurious versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simple diggings <b>of</b> old. But suitable sites for these large <b>and</b> ramifying tunnels (<b>or</b> smials as they called them) were not everywhere <b>to</b> be found; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> flats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> low-lying districts <b>the</b> Hobbits, as they multiplied, began <b>to</b> build above ground. Indeed, even in <b>the</b> hilly regions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> older villages, such as Hobbiton <b>or</b> Tuckborough, <b>or</b> in <b>the</b> chief township <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, Michel Delving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> White Downs, there were now many houses <b>of</b> wood, brick, <b>or</b> stone. These were specially favoured <b>by</b> millers, smiths, ropers, <b>and</b> cartwrights, <b>and</b> others <b>of</b> that sort; for even when they had holes <b>to</b> live in. Hobbits had long been accustomed <b>to</b> build sheds <b>and</b> workshops.
<br>   The habit <b>of</b> building farmhouses <b>and</b> barns was said <b>to</b> have begun among <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine. The Hobbits <b>of</b> that quarter, <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, were rather large <b>and</b> heavy-legged, <b>and</b> they wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known <b>to</b> be Stoors in a large part <b>of</b> their blood, as indeed was shown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> down that many grew <b>on</b> their chins. No Harfoot <b>or</b> Fallohide had any trace <b>of</b> a beard. Indeed, <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Buckland, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, which they afterwards occupied, came for <b>the</b> most part later <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Shire up from south-away; <b>and</b> they still had many peculiar names <b>and</b> strange words not found elsewhere in <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   It is probable that <b>the</b> craft <b>of</b> building, as many other crafts beside, was derived from <b>the</b> D?nedain. But <b>the</b> Hobbits may have learned <b>it</b> direct from <b>the</b> Elves, <b>the</b> teachers <b>of</b> Men in their youth. For <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, <b>and</b> they dwelt still at that time at <b>the</b> Grey Havens away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, <b>and</b> in other places within reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Three Elf-towers <b>of</b> immemorial age were still <b>to</b> be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tower Hills beyond <b>the</b> western marches. They shone far off in <b>the</b> moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The Hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Westfarthing said that one could see <b>the</b> Sea from <b>the</b> lop <b>of</b> that tower; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> Hobbit had ever been known <b>to</b> climb <b>it</b>. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen <b>or</b> sailed upon <b>the</b> Sea, <b>and</b> fewer still had ever returned <b>to</b> report <b>it</b>. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers <b>and</b> small boats with deep misgivings, <b>and</b> not many <b>of</b> them could swim. And as <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire lengthened they spoke less <b>and</b> less with <b>the</b> Elves, <b>and</b> grew afraid <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> distrustful <b>of</b> those that had dealings with them; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea became a word <b>of</b> fear among them, <b>and</b> a token <b>of</b> death, <b>and</b> they turned their faces away from <b>the</b> hills in <b>the</b> west.
<br>   The craft <b>of</b> building may have come from Elves <b>or</b> Men, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits used <b>it</b> in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, <b>and</b> comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, <b>no</b> more than built imitations <b>of</b> smials, thatched with dry grass <b>or</b> straw, <b>or</b> roofed with turves, <b>and</b> having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> hobbit-building had long since been altered, improved <b>by</b> devices, learned from Dwarves, <b>or</b> discovered <b>by</b> themselves. A preference for round windows, <b>and</b> even round doors, was <b>the</b> chief remaining peculiarity <b>of</b> hobbit-architecture.
<br>   The houses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> holes <b>of</b> Shire-hobbits were often large, <b>and</b> inhabited <b>by</b> large families. (Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship with <b>the</b> Elves.) Sometimes, as in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tooks <b>of</b> Great Smials, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>of</b> Brandy Hall, many generations <b>of</b> relatives lived in (comparative) peace together in one ancestral <b>and</b> many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, in any case, clannish <b>and</b> reckoned up their relationships with great care. They drew long <b>and</b> elaborate family-trees with innumerable branches. In dealing with Hobbits <b>it</b> is important <b>to</b> remember who is related <b>to</b> whom, <b>and</b> in what degree. It would be impossible in this book <b>to</b> set out a family-tree that included even <b>the</b> more important members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more important families at <b>the</b> time which these tales tell <b>of</b>. The genealogical trees at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> Westmarch are a small book in themselves, <b>and</b> all <b>but</b> Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked <b>to</b> have books filled with things that they already knew, set out fair <b>and</b> square with <b>no</b> contradictions.
<br>   
<br>
<br>2. Concerning Pipe-weed
<br>   
<br>   There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits <b>of</b> old that must be mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed <b>or</b> inhaled, through pipes <b>of</b> clay <b>or</b> wood, <b>the</b> smoke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burning leaves <b>of</b> a herb, which they called pipe-weed <b>or</b> leaf, a variety probably <b>of</b> Nicotiana. A great deal <b>of</b> mystery surrounds <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> this peculiar custom, <b>or</b> “art” as <b>the</b> Hobbits preferred <b>to</b> call <b>it</b>. All that could be discovered about <b>it</b> in antiquity was put together <b>by</b> Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master <b>of</b> Buckland), <b>and</b> since he <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tobacco <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southfarthing play a part in <b>the</b> history that follows, his remarks in <b>the</b> introduction <b>to</b> his Herblore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire may be quoted.
<br>   “This,” he says, “is <b>the</b> one art that we can certainly claim <b>to</b> be our own invention. When Hobbits first began <b>to</b> smoke is not known, all <b>the</b> legends <b>and</b> family histories take <b>it</b> for granted; for ages folk in <b>the</b> Shire smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold Hornblower <b>of</b> Longbottom in <b>the</b> Southfarthing first grew <b>the</b> true pipe-weed in his gardens in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Isengrim <b>the</b> Second, about <b>the</b> year 1070 <b>of</b> Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district, especially <b>the</b> varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, <b>and</b> Southern Star.
<br>   “How Old Toby came <b>by</b> <b>the</b> plant is not recorded, for <b>to</b> his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, <b>but</b> he was <b>no</b> traveller. It is said that in his youth he went often <b>to</b> Bree, though he certainly never went further from <b>the</b> Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned <b>of</b> this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, <b>it</b> grows well <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. The Bree-hobbits claim <b>to</b> have been <b>the</b> first actual smokers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipe-weed. They claim, <b>of</b> course, <b>to</b> have done everything before <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, whom they refer <b>to</b> as “colonists"; <b>but</b> in this case their claim is, I think, likely <b>to</b> be true. And certainly <b>it</b> was from Bree that <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> smoking <b>the</b> genuine weed spread in <b>the</b> recent centuries among Dwarves <b>and</b> such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, <b>or</b> wanderers, as still passed <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro through that ancient road-meeting. The home <b>and</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> an is thus <b>to</b> be found in <b>the</b> old inn <b>of</b> Bree, The Prancing Pony, that has been kept <b>by</b> <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> Butterbur from time beyond record.
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same, observations that I have made <b>on</b> my own many journeys south have convinced me that <b>the</b> weed itself is not native <b>to</b> our parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>but</b> came northward from <b>the</b> lower Anduin, whither <b>it</b> was, I suspect, originally brought over Sea <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Westernesse. It grows abundantly in Gondor, <b>and</b> there is richer <b>and</b> larger than in <b>the</b> North, where <b>it</b> is never found wild, <b>and</b> flourishes only in warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men <b>of</b> Gondor call <b>it</b> sweet galenas, <b>and</b> esteem <b>it</b> only for <b>the</b> fragrance <b>of</b> its flowers. From that land <b>it</b> must have been carried up <b>the</b> Greenway during <b>the</b> long centuries between <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> Elendil <b>and</b> our own day. But even <b>the</b> D?nedain <b>of</b> Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits first put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> pipes. Not even <b>the</b> Wizards first thought <b>of</b> that before we did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up <b>the</b> art long ago, <b>and</b> became as skilful in <b>it</b> as in all other things that he put his mind <b>to</b>.”
<br>
<br>
<br>3. Of <b>the</b> Ordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire
<br>   
<br>   The Shire was divided <b>into</b> four quarters, <b>the</b> Farthings already referred <b>to</b>. North, South, East, <b>and</b> West; <b>and</b> these again each <b>into</b> a number <b>of</b> folklands, which still bore <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old leading families, although <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> this history these names were <b>no</b> longer found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in <b>the</b> Tookland, <b>but</b> that was not true <b>of</b> many other families, such as <b>the</b> Bagginses <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Boffins. Outside <b>the</b> Farthings were <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> West Marches: <b>the</b> Buckland (see beginning <b>of</b> Chapter V, Book I); <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Westmarch added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire in S.R. 1462.
<br>   The Shire at this time had hardly any “government”. Families for <b>the</b> most part managed their own affairs. Growing food <b>and</b> eating <b>it</b> occupied most <b>of</b> their time. In other matters they were, as a rule, generous <b>and</b> not greedy, <b>but</b> contented <b>and</b> moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, <b>and</b> small trades tended <b>to</b> remain unchanged for generations.
<br>   There remained, <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> ancient tradition concerning <b>the</b> high king at Fornost, <b>or</b> Norbury as they called <b>it</b>, away north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. But there had been <b>no</b> king for nearly a thousand years, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> Kings” Norbury were covered with grass. Yet <b>the</b> Hobbits still said <b>of</b> wild folk <b>and</b> wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king. For they attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king <b>of</b> old all their essential laws; <b>and</b> usually they kept <b>the</b> laws <b>of</b> free will, because they were The Rules (as they said), both ancient <b>and</b> just.
<br>   It is true that <b>the</b> Took family had long been pre-eminent; for <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> Thain had passed <b>to</b> them (from <b>the</b> Oldbucks) some centuries before, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chief Took had borne that title ever since. The Thain was <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire-moot, <b>and</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire-muster <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hobbitry-in-arms, <b>but</b> as muster <b>and</b> moot were only held in times <b>of</b> emergency, which <b>no</b> longer occurred, <b>the</b> Thainship had ceased <b>to</b> be more than a nominal dignity. The Took family was still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for <b>it</b> remained both numerous <b>and</b> exceedingly wealthy, <b>and</b> was liable <b>to</b> produce in every generation strong characters <b>of</b> peculiar habits <b>and</b> even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were now rather tolerated (in <b>the</b> rich) than generally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, <b>of</b> referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family as The Took, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> adding <b>to</b> his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim <b>the</b> Second, for instance.
<br>   The only real official in <b>the</b> Shire at this date was <b>the</b> Mayor <b>of</b> Michel Delving (<b>or</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire), who was elected every seven years at <b>the</b> Free Fair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> White Downs at <b>the</b> Lithe, that is at Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty was <b>to</b> preside at banquets, given <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But <b>the</b> offices <b>of</b> Postmaster <b>and</b> First Shirriff were attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mayoralty, so that he managed both <b>the</b> Messenger Service <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Watch. These were <b>the</b> only Shire-services, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Messengers were <b>the</b> most numerous, <b>and</b> much <b>the</b> busier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two. By <b>no</b> means all Hobbits were lettered, <b>but</b> those who were wrote constantly <b>to</b> all their friends (<b>and</b> a selection <b>of</b> their relations) who lived further off than an afternoon's walk.
<br>   The Shirriffs was <b>the</b> name that <b>the</b> Hobbits gave <b>to</b> their police, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, <b>of</b> course, <b>no</b> uniforms (such things being quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; <b>and</b> they were in practice rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with <b>the</b> strayings <b>of</b> beasts than <b>of</b> people. There were in all <b>the</b> Shire only twelve <b>of</b> them, three in each Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body, varying at need, was employed <b>to</b> “beat <b>the</b> bounds”, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> see that Outsiders <b>of</b> any kind, great <b>or</b> small, did not make themselves a nuisance.
<br>   At <b>the</b> time when this story begins <b>the</b> Bounders, as they were called, had been greatly increased. There were many reports <b>and</b> complaints <b>of</b> strange persons <b>and</b> creatures prowling about <b>the</b> borders, <b>or</b> over them: <b>the</b> first sign that all was not quite as <b>it</b> should be, <b>and</b> always had been except in tales <b>and</b> legends <b>of</b> long ago. Few heeded <b>the</b> sign, <b>and</b> not even Bilbo yet had any notion <b>of</b> what <b>it</b> portended. Sixty years had passed since he set out <b>on</b> his memorable journey, <b>and</b> he was old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundred as often as not; <b>but</b> much evidently still remained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considerable wealth that he had brought back. How much <b>or</b> how little he revealed <b>to</b> <b>no</b> one, not even <b>to</b> Frodo his favourite “nephew”. And he still kept secret <b>the</b> ring that he bad found.
<br>
<br>
<br>4. Of <b>the</b> Finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring
<br>   
<br>   As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day <b>to</b> Bilbo's door <b>the</b> great Wizard, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey, <b>and</b> thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant <b>of</b> kings, <b>and</b> his twelve companions in exile. With them he set out, <b>to</b> his own lasting astonishment, <b>on</b> a morning <b>of</b> April, <b>it</b> being then <b>the</b> year 1341 Shire-reckoning, <b>on</b> a quest <b>of</b> great treasure, <b>the</b> dwarf-hoards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings under <b>the</b> Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off in <b>the</b> East. The quest was successful, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dragon that guarded <b>the</b> hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies was fought, <b>and</b> Thorin was slain, <b>and</b> many deeds <b>of</b> renown were done, <b>the</b> matter would scarcely have concerned later history, <b>or</b> earned more than a note in <b>the</b> long annals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age, <b>but</b> for an “accident” <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way. The party was assailed <b>by</b> Orcs in a high pass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; <b>and</b> so <b>it</b> happened that Bilbo was lost for a while in <b>the</b> black orc-mines deep under <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> there, as he groped in vain in <b>the</b> dark, he put his hand <b>on</b> a ring, lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> a tunnel. He put <b>it</b> in his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.
<br>   Trying <b>to</b> find his way out. Bilbo went <b>on</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, until he could go <b>no</b> further. At <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel lay a cold lake far from <b>the</b> light, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> an island <b>of</b> rock in <b>the</b> water lived Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes <b>and</b> catching blind fish with his long fingers, <b>and</b> eating them raw. He ate any living thing, even orc, if he could catch <b>it</b> <b>and</b> strangle <b>it</b> without a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that had come <b>to</b> him long ages ago, when he still lived in <b>the</b> light: a ring <b>of</b> gold that made its wearer invisible. It was <b>the</b> one thing he loved, his “precious”, <b>and</b> he talked <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, even when <b>it</b> was not with him. For he kept <b>it</b> hidden safe in a hole <b>on</b> his island, except when he was hunting <b>or</b> spying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mines.
<br>   Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if <b>the</b> ring had been <b>on</b> him when they met; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was not, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as a sword. So <b>to</b> gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not guess, then he would kill him <b>and</b> eat him; <b>but</b> if Bilbo defeated him, then he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him <b>to</b> a way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnels.
<br>   Since he was lost in <b>the</b> dark without hope, <b>and</b> could neither go <b>on</b> nor back. Bilbo accepted <b>the</b> challenge; <b>and</b> they asked one another many riddles. In <b>the</b> end Bilbo won <b>the</b> game, more <b>by</b> luck (as <b>it</b> seemed) than <b>by</b> wits; for he was stumped at last for a riddle <b>to</b> ask, <b>and</b> cried out, as his hand came upon <b>the</b> ring he lad picked up <b>and</b> forgotten: What haw I got in my pocket? This Gollum failed <b>to</b> answer, though he demanded three guesses.
<br>   The Authorities, <b>it</b> is true, differ whether this last question was a mere “question” <b>and</b> not a “riddle” according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strict rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game; <b>but</b> all agree that, after accepting <b>it</b> <b>and</b> trying <b>to</b> guess <b>the</b> answer, Gollum was bound <b>by</b> his promise. And Bilbo pressed him <b>to</b> keep his word; for <b>the</b> thought came <b>to</b> him that this slimy creature might prove false, even though such promises were held sacred, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> old all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wickedest things feared <b>to</b> break them. But after ages alone in <b>the</b> dark Gollum’s heart was black, <b>and</b> treachery was in <b>it</b>. He slipped away, <b>and</b> returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, <b>of</b> which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in <b>the</b> dark water. There, he thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now, <b>and</b> angry, <b>and</b> once his “precious” was with him he would not fear any weapon at all.
<br>   But <b>the</b> ring was not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island; he had lost <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> was gone. His screech sent a shiver down Bilbo's back, though he did not yet understand what had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped <b>to</b> a guess, too late. What has <b>it</b> got in its pocketses? he cried. The light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back <b>to</b> murder <b>the</b> hobbit <b>and</b> recover his “precious”. Just in time Bilbo saw his peril, <b>and</b> he fled blindly up <b>the</b> passage away from <b>the</b> water; <b>and</b> once more he was saved <b>by</b> his luck. For just as he ran he put his hand in his pocket, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ring slipped quietly <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his finger. So <b>it</b> was that Gollum passed him without seeing him, <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> guard <b>the</b> way out, lest <b>the</b> “thief” should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went along, cursing, <b>and</b> talking <b>to</b> himself about his “precious”; from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed <b>the</b> truth, <b>and</b> hope came <b>to</b> him in <b>the</b> darkness: he himself had found <b>the</b> marvellous ring <b>and</b> a chance <b>of</b> escape from <b>the</b> orcs <b>and</b> from Gollum.
<br>   At length they came <b>to</b> a halt before an unseen opening that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower gates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mines, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastward side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling <b>and</b> listening; <b>and</b> Bilbo was tempted <b>to</b> slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, <b>and</b> though he kept <b>the</b> ring, in which his only hope lay, he would not use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> help him kill <b>the</b> wretched creature at a disadvantage. In <b>the</b> end, gathering his courage, he leaped over Gollum in <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> fled away down <b>the</b> passage, pursued <b>by</b> his enemy's cries <b>of</b> hate <b>and</b> despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates <b>it</b> for ever!
<br>   Now <b>it</b> is a curious fact that this is not <b>the</b> story as Bilbo first told <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his companions. To them his account was that Gollum had promised <b>to</b> give him a present, if he won <b>the</b> game; <b>but</b> when Gollum went <b>to</b> fetch <b>it</b> from his island he found <b>the</b> treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been given <b>to</b> him long ago <b>on</b> his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was <b>the</b> very ring that he had found, <b>and</b> as he had won <b>the</b> game, <b>it</b> was already his <b>by</b> right. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> made Gollum show him <b>the</b> way out, as a reward instead <b>of</b> a present. This account Bilbo set down in his memoirs, <b>and</b> he seems never <b>to</b> have altered <b>it</b> himself, not even after <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> Elrond. Evidently <b>it</b> still appeared in <b>the</b> original Red Book, as <b>it</b> did in several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copies <b>and</b> abstracts. But many copies contain <b>the</b> true account (as an alternative), derived <b>no</b> doubt from notes <b>by</b> Frodo <b>or</b> Samwise, both <b>of</b> whom learned <b>the</b> truth, though they seem <b>to</b> have been unwilling <b>to</b> delete anything actually written <b>by</b> <b>the</b> old hobbit himself.
<br>   Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> he continued <b>to</b> be very curious about <b>the</b> ring. Eventually he got <b>the</b> true tale out <b>of</b> Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wizard seemed <b>to</b> think <b>the</b> truth important. Though he did not say so <b>to</b> Bilbo, he also thought <b>it</b> important, <b>and</b> disturbing, <b>to</b> find that <b>the</b> good hobbit had not told <b>the</b> truth from <b>the</b> first: quite contrary <b>to</b> his habit. The idea <b>of</b> a “present” was not mere hobbitlike invention, all <b>the</b> same. It was suggested <b>to</b> Bilbo, as he confessed, <b>by</b> Gollum's talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call <b>the</b> ring his “birthday present”, many times. That also Gandalf thought strange <b>and</b> suspicious; <b>but</b> he did not discover <b>the</b> truth in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this book.
<br>   Of Bilbo's later adventures little more need be said here. With <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring he escaped from <b>the</b> orc-guards at <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> rejoined his companions. He used <b>the</b> ring many times <b>on</b> his quest, chiefly for <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> his friends; <b>but</b> he kept <b>it</b> secret from them as long as he could. After his return <b>to</b> his home he never spoke <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again <b>to</b> anyone, save Gandalf <b>and</b> Frodo; <b>and</b> <b>no</b> one else in <b>the</b> Shire knew <b>of</b> its existence, <b>or</b> so he believed. Only <b>to</b> Frodo did he show <b>the</b> account <b>of</b> his Journey that he was writing.
<br>   His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, <b>and</b> his coat <b>of</b> marvellous mail, <b>the</b> gift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves from <b>the</b> Dragon-hoard, he lent <b>to</b> a museum, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer at Bag End <b>the</b> old cloak <b>and</b> hood that he had worn <b>on</b> his travels; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ring, secured <b>by</b> a fine chain, remained in his pocket.
<br>   He returned <b>to</b> his home at Bag End <b>on</b> June <b>the</b> 22nd in his fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), <b>and</b> nothing very notable occurred in <b>the</b> Shire until Mr. Baggins began <b>the</b> preparations for <b>the</b> celebration <b>of</b> his hundred-<b>and</b>-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History begins.
<br>   At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age <b>the</b> part played <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits in <b>the</b> great events that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire in <b>the</b> Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> their traditions, up <b>to</b> that time still mainly oral, were collected <b>and</b> Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events in <b>the</b> Kingdom at large, <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> their members studied its ancient histories <b>and</b> legends. By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first century <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Age there were already <b>to</b> be found in <b>the</b> Shire several libraries that contained many historical books <b>and</b> records.
<br>   The largest <b>of</b> these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, <b>and</b> at Brandy Hall. This account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age is drawn mainly from <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> Westmarch. That most important source for <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring was so called because <b>it</b> was long preserved at Undertowers, <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fairbairns, Wardens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Westmarch.3 It was in origin Bilbo's private diary, which he took with him <b>to</b> Rivendell. Frodo brought <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire, together with many loose leaves <b>of</b> notes, <b>and</b> during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War. But annexed <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> preserved with <b>it</b>, probably m a single red case, were <b>the</b> three large volumes, bound in red leather, that Bilbo gave <b>to</b> him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there was added in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, <b>and</b> various other matter concerning <b>the</b> hobbit members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fellowship.
<br>   The original Red Book has not been preserved, <b>but</b> many copies were made, especially <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first volume, for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> Master Samwise. The most important copy, however, has a different history. It was kept at Great Smials, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was written in Condor, probably at <b>the</b> request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great-grandson <b>of</b> Peregrin, <b>and</b> completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note: Findegil, King's Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact copy in all details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thain's Book m Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, made at <b>the</b> request <b>of</b> King Elessar, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Periannath, <b>and</b> was brought <b>to</b> him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Thain Peregrin when he retired <b>to</b> Gondor in IV 64.
<br>   The Thain's Book was thus <b>the</b> first copy made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book <b>and</b> contained much that was later omitted <b>or</b> lost. In Minas Tirith <b>it</b> received much annotation, <b>and</b> many corrections, especially <b>of</b> names, words, <b>and</b> quotations in <b>the</b> Elvish languages; <b>and</b> there was added <b>to</b> <b>it</b> an abbreviated version <b>of</b> those parts <b>of</b> The Tale <b>of</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> Arwen which lie outside <b>the</b> account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War. The full tale is stated <b>to</b> have been written <b>by</b> Barahir, grandson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Steward Faramir, some time after <b>the</b> passing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King. But <b>the</b> chief importance <b>of</b> Findegil's copy is that <b>it</b> alone contains <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> Bilbo's “Translations from <b>the</b> Elvish”. These three volumes were found <b>to</b> be a work <b>of</b> great skill <b>and</b> learning in which, between 1403 <b>and</b> 1418, he had used all <b>the</b> sources available <b>to</b> him in Rivendell, both living <b>and</b> written. But since they were little used <b>by</b> Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with <b>the</b> Elder Days, <b>no</b> more is said <b>of</b> them here.
<br>   Since Meriadoc <b>and</b> Peregrin became <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> their great families, <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> same time kept up their connexions with Rohan <b>and</b> Gondor, <b>the</b> libraries at Bucklebury <b>and</b> Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in <b>the</b> Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador <b>and</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Rohan. Some <b>of</b> these were composed <b>or</b> begun <b>by</b> Meriadoc himself, though in <b>the</b> Shire he was chiefly remembered for his Herblore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> for his Reckoning <b>of</b> Years m which he discussed <b>the</b> relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calendars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> Bree <b>to</b> those <b>of</b> Rivendell, Gondor, <b>and</b> Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise <b>on</b> Old Words <b>and</b> Names in <b>the</b> Shire, having special interest in discovering <b>the</b> kinship with <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rohirrim <b>of</b> such “shire-words” as mathom <b>and</b> old elements in place names.
<br>   At Great Smials <b>the</b> books were <b>of</b> less interest <b>to</b> Shire-folk, though more important for larger history. None <b>of</b> them was written <b>by</b> Peregrin, <b>but</b> he <b>and</b> his successors collected many manuscripts written <b>by</b> scribes <b>of</b> Gondor: mainly copies <b>or</b> summaries <b>of</b> histories <b>or</b> legends relating <b>to</b> Elendil <b>and</b> his heirs. Only here in <b>the</b> Shire were <b>to</b> be found extensive materials for <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> N?menor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arising <b>of</b> Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that The Tale <b>of</b> Years4 was put together, with <b>the</b> assistance <b>of</b> material collected <b>by</b> Meriadoc. Though <b>the</b> dates given are often conjectural, especially for <b>the</b> Second Age, they deserve attention. It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance <b>and</b> information from Rivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had departed, his sons long remained, together with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High-elven folk. It is said that Celeborn went <b>to</b> dwell there after <b>the</b> departure <b>of</b> Galadriel; <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day when at last he sought <b>the</b> Grey Havens, <b>and</b> with him went <b>the</b> last living memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days in Middle-earth.

<br>Chapter 1
<br>A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY
<br>   
<br>   When Mr. Bilbo Baggins <b>of</b> Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party <b>of</b> special magnificence, there was much talk <b>and</b> excitement in Hobbiton.
<br>   Bilbo was very rich <b>and</b> very peculiar, <b>and</b> had been <b>the</b> wonder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance <b>and</b> unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was popularly believed, whatever <b>the</b> old folk might say, that <b>the</b> Hill at Bag End was full <b>of</b> tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour <b>to</b> marvel at. Time wore <b>on</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> have little effect <b>on</b> Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much <b>the</b> same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began <b>to</b> call him well-preserved, <b>but</b> unchanged would have been nearer <b>the</b> mark. There were some that shook their heads <b>and</b> thought this was too much <b>of</b> a good thing; <b>it</b> seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
<br>   “It will have <b>to</b> be paid for,” they said. “It isn’t natural, <b>and</b> trouble will come <b>of</b> <b>it</b>!”
<br>   But so far trouble had not come; <b>and</b> as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing <b>to</b> forgive him his oddities <b>and</b> his good fortune. He remained <b>on</b> visiting terms with his relatives (except, <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses), <b>and</b> he had many devoted admirers among <b>the</b> hobbits <b>of</b> poor <b>and</b> unimportant families. But he had <b>no</b> close friends, until some <b>of</b> his younger cousins began <b>to</b> grow up.
<br>   The eldest <b>of</b> these, <b>and</b> Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, <b>and</b> brought him <b>to</b> live at Bag End; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo happened <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> same birthday, September 22nd. “You had better come <b>and</b> live here, Frodo my lad,” said Bilbo one day; “<b>and</b> then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.” At that time Frodo was still in his tweens, as <b>the</b> hobbits called <b>the</b> irresponsible twenties between childhood <b>and</b> coming <b>of</b> age at thirty-three.
<br>   Twelve more years passed. Each year <b>the</b> Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; <b>but</b> now <b>it</b> was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going <b>to</b> be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number <b>and</b> a very respectable age for a hobbit (<b>the</b> Old Took himself had only reached 130); <b>and</b> Frodo was going <b>to</b> be thirty-three, 33) an important number: <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> his “coming <b>of</b> age”.
<br>   Tongues began <b>to</b> wag in Hobbiton <b>and</b> Bywater; <b>and</b> rumour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming event travelled all over <b>the</b> Shire. The history <b>and</b> character <b>of</b> Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again <b>the</b> chief topic <b>of</b> conversation; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.
<br>   No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as <b>the</b> Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bywater road; <b>and</b> he spoke with some authority, for he had tended <b>the</b> garden at Bag End for forty years, <b>and</b> had helped old Holman in <b>the</b> same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old <b>and</b> stiff in <b>the</b> joints, <b>the</b> job was mainly carried <b>on</b> <b>by</b> his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father <b>and</b> son were <b>on</b> very friendly terms with Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo. They lived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.
<br>   “A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I’ve always said,” <b>the</b> Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite <b>to</b> him, calling him “Master Hamfast”, <b>and</b> consulting him constantly upon <b>the</b> growing <b>of</b> vegetables—in <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> “roots”, especially potatoes, <b>the</b> Gaffer was recognized as <b>the</b> leading authority <b>by</b> all in <b>the</b> neighbourhood (including himself).
<br>   “But what about this Frodo that lives with him?” asked Old Noakes <b>of</b> Bywater. “Baggins is his name, <b>but</b> he’s more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins <b>of</b> Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.”
<br>   “And <b>no</b> wonder they’re queer,” put in Daddy Twofoot (<b>the</b> Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), “if they live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine River, <b>and</b> right agin <b>the</b> Old Forest. That’s a dark bad place, if half <b>the</b> tales be true.”
<br>   “You’re right, Dad!” said <b>the</b> Gaffer. “Not that <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>of</b> Buck-land live in <b>the</b> Old Forest; <b>but</b> they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats <b>on</b> that big river—<b>and</b> that isn’t natural. Small wonder that trouble came <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, I say. But be that as <b>it</b> may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish <b>to</b> meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, <b>and</b> in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much <b>to</b> tell <b>of</b> him, till he was drownded.”
<br>   “Drownded?” said several voices. They had heard this <b>and</b> other darker rumours before, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> hobbits have a passion for family history, <b>and</b> they were ready <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b> again. “Well, so they say,” said <b>the</b> Gaffer. “You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo’s first cousin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mother’s side (her mother being <b>the</b> youngest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Took’s daughters); <b>and</b> Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first <b>and</b> second cousin, once removed either way, as <b>the</b> saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial <b>to</b> his vittles, <b>and</b> old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); <b>and</b> he went out boating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine River; <b>and</b> he <b>and</b> his wife were drownded, <b>and</b> poor Mr. Frodo only a child <b>and</b> all.”
<br>   “I’ve heard they went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water after dinner in <b>the</b> moonlight,” said Old Noakes; “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> was Drogo’s weight as sunk <b>the</b> boat.”
<br>   “And I heard she pushed him in, <b>and</b> he pulled her in after him,” said Sandyman, <b>the</b> Hobbiton miller.
<br>   “You shouldn’t listen <b>to</b> all you hear, Sandyman,” said <b>the</b> Gaffer, who did not much like <b>the</b> miller. “There isn’t <b>no</b> call <b>to</b> go talking <b>of</b> pushing <b>and</b> pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan <b>and</b> stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, <b>by</b> all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple <b>of</b> hundred relations in <b>the</b> place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought <b>the</b> lad back <b>to</b> live among decent folk.
<br>   “But I reckon <b>it</b> was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they were going <b>to</b> get Bag End, that time when he went off <b>and</b> was thought <b>to</b> be dead. And then he comes back <b>and</b> orders them off; <b>and</b> he goes <b>on</b> living <b>and</b> living, <b>and</b> never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, <b>and</b> has all <b>the</b> papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> Bag End now, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> is <b>to</b> be hoped not.”
<br>   “There’s a tidy bit <b>of</b> money tucked away up there, I hear tell,” said a stranger, a visitor <b>on</b> business from Michel Delving in <b>the</b> Westfarthing. “All <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> your hill is full <b>of</b> tunnels packed with chests <b>of</b> gold <b>and</b> silver, <b>and</b> jools, <b>by</b> what I’ve heard.”
<br>   “Then you’ve heard more than I can speak <b>to</b>,” answered <b>the</b> Gaffer. I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, <b>and</b> there seems <b>no</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> I know <b>of</b> <b>no</b> tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter <b>of</b> sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not long come prentice <b>to</b> old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin), <b>but</b> he had me up at Bag End helping him <b>to</b> keep folks from trampling <b>and</b> trapessing all over <b>the</b> garden while <b>the</b> sale was <b>on</b>. And in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all Mr. Bilbo comes up <b>the</b> Hill with a pony <b>and</b> some mighty big bags <b>and</b> a couple <b>of</b> chests. I don’t doubt they were mostly full <b>of</b> treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains <b>of</b> gold, they say; <b>but</b> there wasn’t enough <b>to</b> fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He’s in <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> Bag End. Crazy about stories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old days he is, <b>and</b> he listens <b>to</b> all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters—meaning <b>no</b> harm, mark you, <b>and</b> I hope <b>no</b> harm will come <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Elves <b>and</b> Dragons” I says <b>to</b> him. “Cabbages <b>and</b> potatoes are better for me <b>and</b> you. Don’t go getting mixed up in <b>the</b> business <b>of</b> your betters, <b>or</b> you’ll land in trouble too big for you,” I says <b>to</b> him. And I might say <b>it</b> <b>to</b> others,” he added with a look at <b>the</b> stranger <b>and</b> <b>the</b> miller.
<br>   But <b>the</b> Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend <b>of</b> Bilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> younger generation <b>of</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Ah, <b>but</b> he has likely enough been adding <b>to</b> what he brought at first,” argued <b>the</b> miller, voicing common opinion. “He’s often away from home. And look at <b>the</b> outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, <b>and</b> that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, <b>and</b> all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, <b>but</b> Bag End’s a queer place, <b>and</b> its folk are queerer.”
<br>   “And you can say what you like, about what you know <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> than you do <b>of</b> boating, Mr. Sandyman,” retorted <b>the</b> Gaffer, disliking <b>the</b> miller even more than usual. If that’s being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There’s some not far away that wouldn’t offer a pint <b>of</b> beer <b>to</b> a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone’s going <b>to</b> be invited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> party, <b>and</b> there’s going <b>to</b> be presents, mark you, presents for all—this very month as is.”
<br>   That very month was September, <b>and</b> as fine as you could ask. A day <b>or</b> two later a rumour (probably started <b>by</b> <b>the</b> knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going <b>to</b> be fireworks—fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in <b>the</b> Shire for nigh <b>on</b> a century, not indeed since <b>the</b> Old Took died.
<br>   Days passed <b>and</b> The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled <b>into</b> Hobbiton one evening <b>and</b> toiled up <b>the</b> Hill <b>to</b> Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out <b>of</b> lamplit doors <b>to</b> gape at <b>it</b>. It was driven <b>by</b> outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards <b>and</b> deep hoods. A few <b>of</b> them remained at Bag End. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving <b>it</b> all alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, <b>and</b> a silver scarf. He had a long white beard <b>and</b> bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond <b>the</b> brim <b>of</b> his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after <b>the</b> cart all through Hobbiton <b>and</b> right up <b>the</b> hill. It had a cargo <b>of</b> fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door <b>the</b> old man began <b>to</b> unload: there were great bundles <b>of</b> fireworks <b>of</b> all sorts <b>and</b> shapes, each labelled with a large red G  <b>and</b> <b>the</b> elf-rune, .
<br>   That was Gandalf’s mark, <b>of</b> course, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old man was Gandalf <b>the</b> Wizard, whose fame in <b>the</b> Shire was due mainly <b>to</b> his skill with fires, smokes, <b>and</b> lights. His real business was far more difficult <b>and</b> dangerous, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk knew nothing about <b>it</b>. To them he was just one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “attractions” at <b>the</b> Party. Hence <b>the</b> excitement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbit-children. “G for Grand!” they shouted, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old man smiled. They knew him <b>by</b> sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally <b>and</b> never stopped long; <b>but</b> neither they nor any <b>but</b> <b>the</b> oldest <b>of</b> their elders had seen one <b>of</b> his firework displays—they now belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legendary past.
<br>   When <b>the</b> old man, helped <b>by</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> some dwarves, had finished unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; <b>but</b> not a single squib <b>or</b> cracker was forthcoming, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disappointment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onlookers.
<br>   “Run away now!” said Gandalf. “You will get plenty when <b>the</b> time comes.” Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> door was shut. The young hobbits stared at <b>the</b> door in vain for a while, <b>and</b> then made off, feeling that <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party would never come.
<br>   Inside Bag End, Bilbo <b>and</b> Gandalf were sitting at <b>the</b> open window <b>of</b> a small room looking out west <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garden. The late afternoon was bright <b>and</b> peaceful. The flowers glowed red <b>and</b> golden: snap-dragons <b>and</b> sun-flowers, <b>and</b> nasturtiums trailing all over <b>the</b> turf walls <b>and</b> peeping in at <b>the</b> round windows.
<br>   “How bright your garden looks!” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Yes,” said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> dear old Shire; <b>but</b> I think I need a holiday.”
<br>   “You mean <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> with your plan then?”
<br>   “I do. I made up my mind months ago, <b>and</b> I haven’t changed <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Very well. It is <b>no</b> good saying any more. Stick <b>to</b> your plan—your whole plan, mind—<b>and</b> I hope <b>it</b> will turn out for <b>the</b> best, for you, <b>and</b> for all <b>of</b> us.”
<br>   “I hope so. Anyway I mean <b>to</b> enjoy myself <b>on</b> Thursday, <b>and</b> have my little joke.”
<br>   “Who will laugh, I wonder?” said Gandalf, shaking his head.
<br>   “We shall see,” said Bilbo.
<br>   The next day more carts rolled up <b>the</b> Hill, <b>and</b> still more carts. There might have been some grumbling about “dealing locally”, <b>but</b> that very week orders began <b>to</b> pour out <b>of</b> Bag End for every kind <b>of</b> provision, commodity, <b>or</b> luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton <b>or</b> Bywater <b>or</b> anywhere in <b>the</b> neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; <b>and</b> they began <b>to</b> tick off <b>the</b> days <b>on</b> <b>the</b> calendar; <b>and</b> they watched eagerly for <b>the</b> postman, hoping for invitations.
<br>   Before long <b>the</b> invitations began pouring out, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hobbiton post-office was blocked, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bywater post-office was snowed under, <b>and</b> voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a constant stream <b>of</b> them going up <b>the</b> Hill, carrying hundreds <b>of</b> polite variations <b>on</b> Thank you, I shall certainly come.
<br>   A notice appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gate at Bag End: <b>no</b> admittance except <b>on</b> party business. Even those who had, <b>or</b> pretended <b>to</b> have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, <b>and</b> making some private preparations <b>of</b> his own. From <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> Gandalf’s arrival he remained hidden from view.
<br>   One morning <b>the</b> hobbits woke <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> large field, south <b>of</b> Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes <b>and</b> poles for tents <b>and</b> pavilions. A special entrance was cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bank leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road, <b>and</b> wide steps <b>and</b> a large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families <b>of</b> Bagshot Row, adjoining <b>the</b> field, were intensely interested <b>and</b> generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending <b>to</b> work in his garden.
<br>   The tents began <b>to</b> go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that <b>the</b> tree that grew in <b>the</b> field was right inside <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> stood proudly near one end, at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief table. Lanterns were hung <b>on</b> all its branches. More promising still (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits” mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in <b>the</b> north corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. A draught <b>of</b> cooks, from every inn <b>and</b> eating-house for miles around, arrived <b>to</b> supplement <b>the</b> dwarves <b>and</b> other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose <b>to</b> its height.
<br>   Then <b>the</b> weather clouded over. That was <b>on</b> Wednesday <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September <b>the</b> 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, <b>the</b> clouds vanished, flags were unfurled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fun began.
<br>   Bilbo Baggins called <b>it</b> a party, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was really a variety <b>of</b> entertainments rolled <b>into</b> one. Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few were overlooked <b>by</b> accident, <b>but</b> as they turned up all <b>the</b> same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire were also asked; <b>and</b> there were even a few from outside <b>the</b> borders. Bilbo met <b>the</b> guests (<b>and</b> additions) at <b>the</b> new white gate in person. He gave away presents <b>to</b> all <b>and</b> sundry—<b>the</b> latter were those who went out again <b>by</b> a back way <b>and</b> came in again <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gate. Hobbits give presents <b>to</b> other people <b>on</b> their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, <b>and</b> not so lavishly as <b>on</b> this occasion; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton <b>and</b> Bywater every day in <b>the</b> year <b>it</b> was somebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance <b>of</b> at least one present at least once a week. But they never got tired <b>of</b> them.
<br>   On this occasion <b>the</b> presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were toys <b>the</b> like <b>of</b> which they had never seen before, all beautiful <b>and</b> some obviously magical. Many <b>of</b> them had indeed been ordered a year before, <b>and</b> had come all <b>the</b> way from <b>the</b> Mountain <b>and</b> from Dale, <b>and</b> were <b>of</b> real dwarf-make.
<br>   When every guest had been welcomed <b>and</b> was finally inside <b>the</b> gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, <b>and</b>, <b>of</b> course, food <b>and</b> drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, <b>and</b> dinner (<b>or</b> supper). But lunch <b>and</b> tea were marked chiefly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that at those times all <b>the</b> guests were sitting down <b>and</b> eating together. At other times there were merely lots <b>of</b> people eating <b>and</b> drinking—continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when <b>the</b> fireworks started.
<br>   The fireworks were <b>by</b> Gandalf: they were not only brought <b>by</b> him, <b>but</b> designed <b>and</b> made <b>by</b> him; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> special effects, set pieces, <b>and</b> flights <b>of</b> rockets were let off <b>by</b> him. But there was also a generous distribution <b>of</b> squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers <b>and</b> thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art <b>of</b> Gandalf improved with age.
<br>   There were rockets like a flight <b>of</b> scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks <b>of</b> dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, <b>and</b> their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon <b>the</b> astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were fountains <b>of</b> butterflies that flew glittering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees; there were pillars <b>of</b> coloured fires that rose <b>and</b> turned <b>into</b> eagles, <b>or</b> sailing ships, <b>or</b> a phalanx <b>of</b> flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm <b>and</b> a shower <b>of</b> yellow rain; there was a forest <b>of</b> silver spears that sprang suddenly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air with a yell like an embattled army, <b>and</b> came down again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in honour <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> startled <b>the</b> hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> glow at <b>the</b> summit. It spouted green <b>and</b> scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon—not life-size, <b>but</b> terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, <b>and</b> he whizzed three times over <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd. They all ducked, <b>and</b> many fell flat <b>on</b> their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, <b>and</b> burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.
<br>   “That is <b>the</b> signal for supper!” said Bilbo. The pain <b>and</b> alarm vanished at once, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prostrate hobbits leaped <b>to</b> their feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> special family dinner-party. This was held in <b>the</b> great pavilion with <b>the</b> tree. The invitations were limited <b>to</b> twelve dozen (a number also called <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hobbits one Gross, though <b>the</b> word was not considered proper <b>to</b> use <b>of</b> people); <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guests were selected from all <b>the</b> families <b>to</b> which Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo were related, with <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, <b>and</b> present <b>by</b> parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> sitting up late, especially when there was a chance <b>of</b> getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot <b>of</b> provender.
<br>   There were many Bagginses <b>and</b> Boffins, <b>and</b> also many Tooks <b>and</b> Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations <b>of</b> Bilbo Baggins” grandmother), <b>and</b> various Chubbs (connexions <b>of</b> his Took grandfather); <b>and</b> a selection <b>of</b> Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers <b>and</b> Proudfoots. Some <b>of</b> these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho <b>and</b> his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo <b>and</b> detested Frodo, <b>but</b> so magnificent was <b>the</b> invitation card, written in golden ink, that they had felt <b>it</b> was impossible <b>to</b> refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years <b>and</b> his table had a high reputation.
<br>   All <b>the</b> one hundred <b>and</b> forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather dreaded <b>the</b> after-dinner speech <b>of</b> their host (an inevitable item). He was liable <b>to</b> drag in bits <b>of</b> what he called poetry; <b>and</b> sometimes, after a glass <b>or</b> two, would allude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> absurd adventures <b>of</b> his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, <b>and</b> prolonged. The purchase <b>of</b> provisions fell almost <b>to</b> nothing throughout <b>the</b> district in <b>the</b> ensuing weeks; <b>but</b> as Bilbo’s catering had depleted <b>the</b> stocks <b>of</b> most stores, cellars <b>and</b> warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.
<br>   After <b>the</b> feast (more <b>or</b> less) came <b>the</b> Speech. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they called “filling up <b>the</b> corners”. They were sipping their favourite drinks, <b>and</b> nibbling at their favourite dainties, <b>and</b> their fears were forgotten. They were prepared <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> anything, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> cheer at every full stop.
<br>   My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. “Hear! Hear! Hear!” they shouted, <b>and</b> kept <b>on</b> repeating <b>it</b> in chorus, seeming reluctant <b>to</b> follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place <b>and</b> went <b>and</b> stood <b>on</b> a chair under <b>the</b> illuminated tree. The light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lanterns fell <b>on</b> his beaming face; <b>the</b> golden buttons shone <b>on</b> his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in <b>the</b> air, <b>the</b> other was in his trouser-pocket.
<br>   My dear Bagginses <b>and</b> Boffins, he began again; <b>and</b> my dear Tooks <b>and</b> Brandybucks, <b>and</b> Grubbs, <b>and</b> Chubbs, <b>and</b> Burrowses, <b>and</b> Hornblowers, <b>and</b> Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses <b>and</b> Proudfoots. “ProudFEET!” shouted an elderly hobbit from <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilion. His name, <b>of</b> course, was Proudfoot, <b>and</b> well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally furry, <b>and</b> both were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table.
<br>   Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last <b>to</b> Bag End. Today is my one hundred <b>and</b> eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! “Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!” they shouted, <b>and</b> they hammered joyously <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly. This was <b>the</b> sort <b>of</b> stuff they liked: short <b>and</b> obvious.
<br>   I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening cheers. Cries <b>of</b> Yes (<b>and</b> No). Noises <b>of</b> trumpets <b>and</b> horns, pipes <b>and</b> flutes, <b>and</b> other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds <b>of</b> musical crackers had been pulled. Most <b>of</b> them bore <b>the</b> mark dale <b>on</b> them; which did not convey much <b>to</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits, <b>but</b> they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> perfect make <b>and</b> enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young Tooks <b>and</b> Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo <b>to</b> have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, <b>and</b> began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took <b>and</b> Miss Melilot Brandybuck got <b>on</b> a table <b>and</b> with bells in their hands began <b>to</b> dance <b>the</b> Springle-ring: a pretty dance, <b>but</b> rather vigorous.
<br>   But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near <b>by</b>, he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall not keep you long, he cried. Cheers from all <b>the</b> assembly. I have called you all together for a Purpose. Something in <b>the</b> way that he said this made an impression. There was almost silence, <b>and</b> one <b>or</b> two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tooks pricked up their ears.
<br>   Indeed, for Three Purposes! First <b>of</b> all, <b>to</b> tell you that I am immensely fond <b>of</b> you all, <b>and</b> that eleventy-one years is too short a time <b>to</b> live among such excellent <b>and</b> admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst <b>of</b> approval.
<br>   I don’t know half <b>of</b> you half as well as I should like; <b>and</b> I like less than half <b>of</b> you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected <b>and</b> rather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, <b>but</b> most <b>of</b> them were trying <b>to</b> work <b>it</b> out <b>and</b> see if <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> a compliment.
<br>   Secondly, <b>to</b> celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR birthday. For <b>it</b> is, <b>of</b> course, also <b>the</b> birthday <b>of</b> my heir <b>and</b> nephew, Frodo. He comes <b>of</b> age <b>and</b> <b>into</b> his inheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping <b>by</b> <b>the</b> elders; <b>and</b> some loud shouts <b>of</b> “Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,” from <b>the</b> juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, <b>and</b> wondered what was meant <b>by</b> “coming <b>into</b> his inheritance”. Together we score one hundred <b>and</b> forty-four. Your numbers were chosen <b>to</b> fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use <b>the</b> expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many <b>of</b> his guests, <b>and</b> especially <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had only been asked <b>to</b> fill up <b>the</b> required number, like goods in a package. “One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.”
<br>   It is also, if I may be allowed <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> ancient history, <b>the</b> anniversary <b>of</b> my arrival <b>by</b> barrel at Esgaroth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Long Lake; though <b>the</b> fact that <b>it</b> was my birthday slipped my memory <b>on</b> that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, <b>and</b> birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at <b>the</b> time, I remember, <b>and</b> could only say “thag you very buch”. I now repeat <b>it</b> more correctly: Thank you very much for coming <b>to</b> my little party. Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song <b>or</b> some poetry was now imminent; <b>and</b> they were getting bored. Why couldn’t he stop talking <b>and</b> let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing <b>or</b> recite. He paused for a moment.
<br>   Thirdly <b>and</b> finally, he said, I wish <b>to</b> make an ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke this last word so loudly <b>and</b> suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. I regret <b>to</b> announce that—though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time <b>to</b> spend among you—this is <b>the</b> END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!
<br>   He stepped down <b>and</b> vanished. There was a blinding flash <b>of</b> light, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere <b>to</b> be seen. One hundred <b>and</b> forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from <b>the</b> table <b>and</b> stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, <b>and</b> Proudfoot began <b>to</b> talk at once.
<br>   It was generally agreed that <b>the</b> joke was in very bad taste, <b>and</b> more food <b>and</b> drink were needed <b>to</b> cure <b>the</b> guests <b>of</b> shock <b>and</b> annoyance. “He’s mad. I always said so,” was probably <b>the</b> most popular comment. Even <b>the</b> Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For <b>the</b> moment most <b>of</b> them took <b>it</b> for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.
<br>   But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits, <b>and</b> he said <b>to</b> his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: “There’s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn’t taken <b>the</b> vittles with him.” He called loudly <b>to</b> Frodo <b>to</b> send <b>the</b> wine round again.
<br>   Frodo was <b>the</b> only one present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, <b>and</b> ignored all remarks <b>and</b> questions. He had enjoyed <b>the</b> joke, <b>of</b> course, even though he had been in <b>the</b> know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at <b>the</b> indignant surprise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests. But at <b>the</b> same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved <b>the</b> old hobbit dearly. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests went <b>on</b> eating <b>and</b> drinking <b>and</b> discussing Bilbo Baggins” oddities, past <b>and</b> present; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want <b>to</b> have any more <b>to</b> do with <b>the</b> party. He gave orders for more wine <b>to</b> be served; then he got up <b>and</b> drained his own glass silently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> slipped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilion.
<br>   As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been fingering <b>the</b> golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his finger, <b>and</b> he was never seen <b>by</b> any hobbit in Hobbiton again.
<br>   He walked briskly back <b>to</b> his hole, <b>and</b> stood for a moment listening with a smile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> din in <b>the</b> pavilion <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sounds <b>of</b> merrymaking in other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up <b>and</b> wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> away. Then he put <b>on</b> quickly some old untidy garments, <b>and</b> fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On <b>it</b> he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling <b>of</b> moth-balls, he took out an old cloak <b>and</b> hood. They had been locked up as if they were very precious, <b>but</b> they were so patched <b>and</b> weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: <b>it</b> might have been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He then went <b>into</b> his study, <b>and</b> from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, <b>and</b> a leather-bound manuscript; <b>and</b> also a large bulky envelope. The book <b>and</b> bundle he stuffed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into <b>the</b> envelope he slipped his golden ring, <b>and</b> its fine chain, <b>and</b> then sealed <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> addressed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Frodo. At first he put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece, <b>but</b> suddenly he removed <b>it</b> <b>and</b> stuck <b>it</b> in his pocket. At that moment <b>the</b> door opened <b>and</b> Gandalf came quickly in.
<br>   “Hullo!” said Bilbo. “I wondered if you would turn up.”
<br>   “I am glad <b>to</b> find you visible,” replied <b>the</b> wizard, sitting down in a chair, “I wanted <b>to</b> catch you <b>and</b> have a few final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly <b>and</b> according <b>to</b> plan?”
<br>   “Yes, I do,” said Bilbo. “Though that flash was surprising: <b>it</b> quite startled me, let alone <b>the</b> others. A little addition <b>of</b> your own, I suppose?”
<br>   It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me necessary <b>to</b> give your guests something else that would seem <b>to</b> explain your sudden vanishment.”
<br>   “And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,” laughed Bilbo, “<b>but</b> I expect you know best, as usual.”
<br>   “I do—when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure about this whole affair. It has now come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final point. You have had your joke, <b>and</b> alarmed <b>or</b> offended most <b>of</b> your relations, <b>and</b> given <b>the</b> whole Shire something <b>to</b> talk about for nine days, <b>or</b> ninety-nine more likely. Are you going any further?”
<br>   “Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean <b>to</b>, <b>and</b> I have made all arrangements.
<br>   “I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> I am beginning <b>to</b> feel <b>it</b> in my heart <b>of</b> hearts. Well-preserved indeed!” he snorted. “Why, I feel all thin, sort <b>of</b> stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, <b>or</b> something.”
<br>   Gandalf looked curiously <b>and</b> closely at him. “No, <b>it</b> does not seem right,” he said thoughtfully. “No, after all I believe your plan is probably <b>the</b> best.”
<br>   “Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want <b>to</b> see mountains again, Gandalf, mountains, <b>and</b> then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace <b>and</b> quiet, without a lot <b>of</b> relatives prying around, <b>and</b> a string <b>of</b> confounded visitors hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought <b>of</b> a nice ending for <b>it</b>: <b>and</b> he lived happily ever after <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his days.”
<br>   Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read <b>the</b> book, however <b>it</b> ends.”
<br>   “Oh, they may, in years <b>to</b> come. Frodo has read some already, as far as <b>it</b> has gone. You’ll keep an eye <b>on</b> Frodo, won’t you?”
<br>   “Yes, I will—two eyes, as often as I can spare them.”
<br>   “He would come with me, <b>of</b> course, if I asked him. In fact he offered <b>to</b> once, just before <b>the</b> party. But he does not really want <b>to</b>, yet. I want <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> wild country again before I die, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountains; <b>but</b> he is still in love with <b>the</b> Shire, with woods <b>and</b> fields <b>and</b> little rivers. He ought <b>to</b> be comfortable here. I am leaving everything <b>to</b> him, <b>of</b> course, except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he gets used <b>to</b> being <b>on</b> his own. It’s time he was his own master now.”
<br>   “Everything?” said Gandalf. “The ring as well? You agreed <b>to</b> that, you remember.”
<br>   “Well, er, yes, I suppose so,” stammered Bilbo.
<br>   “Where is <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “In an envelope, if you must know,” said Bilbo impatiently. “There <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece. Well, <b>no</b>! Here <b>it</b> is in my pocket!” He hesitated. “Isn’t that odd now?” he said softly <b>to</b> himself. “Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t <b>it</b> stay there?”
<br>   Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, <b>and</b> there was a gleam in his eyes. “I think, Bilbo,” he said quietly, “I should leave <b>it</b> behind. Don’t you want <b>to</b>?”
<br>   “Well yes—<b>and</b> <b>no</b>. Now <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, I don’t like parting with <b>it</b> at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should. Why do you want me <b>to</b>?” he asked, <b>and</b> a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion <b>and</b> annoyance. “You are always badgering me about my ring; <b>but</b> you have never bothered me about <b>the</b> other things that I got <b>on</b> my journey.”
<br>   “No, <b>but</b> I had <b>to</b> badger you,” said Gandalf. “I wanted <b>the</b> truth. It was important. Magic rings are—well, magical; <b>and</b> they are rare <b>and</b> curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; <b>and</b> I still am. I should like <b>to</b> know where <b>it</b> is, if you go wandering again. Also I think you have had <b>it</b> quite long enough. You won’t need <b>it</b> any more. Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.”
<br>   Bilbo flushed, <b>and</b> there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. “Why not?” he cried. “And what business is <b>it</b> <b>of</b> yours, anyway, <b>to</b> know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found <b>it</b>. It came <b>to</b> me.”
<br>   “Yes, yes,” said Gandalf. “But there is <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> get angry.”
<br>   “If I am <b>it</b> is your fault,” said Bilbo. “It is mine, I tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my precious.”
<br>   The wizard’s face remained grave <b>and</b> attentive, <b>and</b> only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled <b>and</b> indeed alarmed. “It has been called that before,” he said, “<b>but</b> not <b>by</b> you.”
<br>   “But I say <b>it</b> now. And why not? Even if Gollum said <b>the</b> same once. It’s not his now, <b>but</b> mine. And I shall keep <b>it</b>, I say.”
<br>   Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. “You will be a fool if you do. Bilbo,” he said. “You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much hold <b>on</b> you. Let <b>it</b> go! And then you can go yourself, <b>and</b> be free.”
<br>   “I’ll do as I choose <b>and</b> go as I please,” said Bilbo obstinately.
<br>   “Now, now, my dear hobbit! “said Gandalf. “All your long life we have been friends, <b>and</b> you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give <b>it</b> up!”
<br>   “Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!” cried Bilbo. “But you won’t get <b>it</b>. I won’t give my precious away, I tell you.” His hand strayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his small sword.
<br>   Gandalf’s eyes flashed. It will be my turn <b>to</b> get angry soon,” he said. If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey uncloaked.” He took a step towards <b>the</b> hobbit, <b>and</b> he seemed <b>to</b> grow tall <b>and</b> menacing; his shadow filled <b>the</b> little room.
<br>   Bilbo backed away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> air <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes remained bent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, <b>and</b> he began <b>to</b> tremble.
<br>   “I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,” he said. “You have never been like this before. What is <b>it</b> all about? It is mine isn’t <b>it</b>? I found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn’t kept <b>it</b>. I’m not a thief, whatever he said.”
<br>   “I have never called you one,” Gandalf answered. “And I am not one either. I am not trying <b>to</b> rob you, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> help you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.” He turned away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow passed. He seemed <b>to</b> dwindle again <b>to</b> an old grey man, bent <b>and</b> troubled.
<br>   Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,” he said. “But I felt so queer. And yet <b>it</b> would be a relief in a way not <b>to</b> be bothered with <b>it</b> any more. It has been so growing <b>on</b> my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt <b>it</b> was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting <b>to</b> put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> disappear, don’t you know; <b>or</b> wondering if <b>it</b> is safe, <b>and</b> pulling <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> make sure. I tried locking <b>it</b> up, <b>but</b> I found I couldn’t rest without <b>it</b> in my pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem able <b>to</b> make up my mind.”
<br>   “Then trust mine,” said Gandalf. “It is quite made up. Go away <b>and</b> leave <b>it</b> behind. Stop possessing <b>it</b>. Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> I will look after him.”
<br>   Bilbo stood for a moment tense <b>and</b> undecided. Presently he sighed. “All right,” he said with an effort. I will.” Then he shrugged his shoulders, <b>and</b> smiled rather ruefully. “After all that’s what this party business was all about, really: <b>to</b> give away lots <b>of</b> birthday presents, <b>and</b> somehow make <b>it</b> easier <b>to</b> give <b>it</b> away at <b>the</b> same time. It hasn’t made <b>it</b> any easier in <b>the</b> end, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> would be a pity <b>to</b> waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil <b>the</b> joke.”
<br>   “Indeed <b>it</b> would take away <b>the</b> only point I ever saw in <b>the</b> affair,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Very well,” said Bilbo, “<b>it</b> goes <b>to</b> Frodo with all <b>the</b> rest.” He drew a deep breath. “And now I really must be starting, <b>or</b> somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, <b>and</b> I couldn’t bear <b>to</b> do <b>it</b> all over again.” He picked up his bag <b>and</b> moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door.
<br>   “You have still got <b>the</b> ring in your pocket,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Well, so I have!” cried Bilbo. “And my will <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> other documents too. You had better take <b>it</b> <b>and</b> deliver <b>it</b> for me. That will be safest.”
<br>   “No, don’t give <b>the</b> ring <b>to</b> me,” said Gandalf. “Put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for him.”
<br>   Bilbo took out <b>the</b> envelope, <b>but</b> just as he was about <b>to</b> set <b>it</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> clock, his hand jerked back, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> packet fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Before he could pick <b>it</b> up, <b>the</b> wizard stooped <b>and</b> seized <b>it</b> <b>and</b> set <b>it</b> in its place. A spasm <b>of</b> anger passed swiftly over <b>the</b> hobbit’s face again. Suddenly <b>it</b> gave way <b>to</b> a look <b>of</b> relief <b>and</b> a laugh. “Well, that’s that,” he said. “Now I’m off!”
<br>   They went out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from <b>the</b> stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out <b>of</b> different rooms where they had been busy.
<br>   “Is everything ready?” asked Bilbo. “Everything packed <b>and</b> labelled?”
<br>   “Everything,” they answered.
<br>   “Well, let’s start then!” He stepped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front-door.
<br>   It was a fine night, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black sky was dotted with stars. He looked up, sniffing <b>the</b> air. “What fun! What fun <b>to</b> be off again, off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye! “he said, looking at his old home <b>and</b> bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. “Good-bye, Gandalf!”
<br>   “Good-bye, for <b>the</b> present, Bilbo. Take care <b>of</b> yourself! You are old enough, <b>and</b> perhaps wise enough.”
<br>   “Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever been, <b>and</b> that is saying a great deal. But <b>the</b> time has come. I am being swept off my feet at last,” he added, <b>and</b> then in a low voice, as if <b>to</b> himself, he sang softly in <b>the</b> dark:
<br>   
<br>The Road goes ever <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b>
<br>Down from <b>the</b> door where <b>it</b> began.
<br>Now far ahead <b>the</b> Road has gone,
<br>And I must follow, if I can,
<br>Pursuing <b>it</b> with eager feet,
<br>Until <b>it</b> joins some larger way
<br>Where many paths <b>and</b> errands meet.
<br>And whither then? I cannot say.
<br>   
<br>   He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned away from <b>the</b> lights <b>and</b> voices in <b>the</b> fields <b>and</b> tents, <b>and</b> followed <b>by</b> his three companions went round <b>into</b> his garden, <b>and</b> trotted down <b>the</b> long sloping path. He jumped over a low place in <b>the</b> hedge at <b>the</b> bottom, <b>and</b> took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meadows, passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night like a rustle <b>of</b> wind in <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   Gandalf remained for a while staring after him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. “Goodbye, my dear Bilbo—until our next meeting!” he said softly <b>and</b> went back indoors.
<br>   Frodo came in soon afterwards, <b>and</b> found him sitting in <b>the</b> dark, deep in thought. “Has he gone?” he asked.
<br>   “Yes,” answered Gandalf, “he has gone at last.”
<br>   “I wish—I mean, I hoped until this evening that <b>it</b> was only a joke,” said Frodo. “But I knew in my heart that he really meant <b>to</b> go. He always used <b>to</b> joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just <b>to</b> see him off.”
<br>   I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in <b>the</b> end,” said Gandalf. “Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right—now. He left a packet for you. There <b>it</b> is!”
<br>   Frodo took <b>the</b> envelope from <b>the</b> mantelpiece, <b>and</b> glanced at <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> did not open <b>it</b>.
<br>   “You’ll find his will <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> other documents in there, I think,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “You are <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.”
<br>   “The ring!” exclaimed Frodo. “Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, <b>it</b> may be useful.”
<br>   “It may, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may not,” said Gandalf. “I should not make use <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, if I were you. But keep <b>it</b> secret, <b>and</b> keep <b>it</b> safe! Now I am going <b>to</b> bed.”
<br>   As master <b>of</b> Bag End Frodo felt <b>it</b> his painful duty <b>to</b> say good-bye <b>to</b> <b>the</b> guests. Rumours <b>of</b> strange events had <b>by</b> now spread all over <b>the</b> field, <b>but</b> Frodo would only say <b>no</b> doubt everything will be cleared up in <b>the</b> morning. About midnight carriages came for <b>the</b> important folk. One <b>by</b> one they rolled away, filled with full <b>but</b> very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came <b>by</b> arrangement, <b>and</b> removed in wheel-barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.
<br>   Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went <b>on</b>. People came <b>and</b> began (<b>by</b> orders) <b>to</b> clear away <b>the</b> pavilions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tables <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chairs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spoons <b>and</b> knives <b>and</b> bottles <b>and</b> plates, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lanterns, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flowering shrubs in boxes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crumbs <b>and</b> cracker-paper, <b>the</b> forgotten bags <b>and</b> gloves <b>and</b> handkerchiefs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number <b>of</b> other people came (without orders): Bagginses, <b>and</b> Boffins, <b>and</b> Bolgers, <b>and</b> Tooks, <b>and</b> other guests that lived <b>or</b> were staying near. By mid-day, when even <b>the</b> best-fed were out <b>and</b> about again, there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited <b>but</b> not unexpected.
<br>   Frodo was waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step, smiling, <b>but</b> looking rather tired <b>and</b> worried. He welcomed all <b>the</b> callers, <b>but</b> he had not much more <b>to</b> say than before. His reply <b>to</b> all inquiries was simply this: “Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.” Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visitors he invited <b>to</b> come inside, as Bilbo had left “messages” for them.
<br>   Inside in <b>the</b> hall there was piled a large assortment <b>of</b> packages <b>and</b> parcels <b>and</b> small articles <b>of</b> furniture. On every item there was a label tied. There were several labels <b>of</b> this sort:
<br>   For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, <b>on</b> an umbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.
<br>   For DORA BAGGINS in memory <b>of</b> a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo, <b>on</b> a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo’s sister <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eldest surviving female relative <b>of</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo; she was ninety-nine, <b>and</b> had written reams <b>of</b> good advice for more than half a century.
<br>   For MILO BURROWS, hoping <b>it</b> will be useful, from B.B., <b>on</b> a gold pen <b>and</b> ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.
<br>   For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo, <b>on</b> a round convex mirror. She was a young Baggins, <b>and</b> too obviously considered her face shapely.
<br>   For <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor, <b>on</b> an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower <b>of</b> books, <b>and</b> worse than usual at returning them.
<br>   For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT, <b>on</b> a case <b>of</b> silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many <b>of</b> his spoons, while he was away <b>on</b> his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in <b>the</b> day, she took <b>the</b> point at once, <b>but</b> she also took <b>the</b> spoons.
<br>   This is only a small selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> his long life. It was a tendency <b>of</b> hobbit-holes <b>to</b> get cluttered up: for which <b>the</b> custom <b>of</b> giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, <b>of</b> course, that <b>the</b> birthday-presents were always new, there were one <b>or</b> two old mathoms <b>of</b> forgotten uses that had circulated all around <b>the</b> district; <b>but</b> Bilbo had usually given new presents, <b>and</b> kept those that he received. The old hole was now being cleared a little.
<br>   Every one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various parting gifts had labels, written out personally <b>by</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> several had some point, <b>or</b> some joke. But, <b>of</b> course, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things were given where they would be wanted <b>and</b> welcome. The poorer hobbits, <b>and</b> especially those <b>of</b> Bagshot Row, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks <b>of</b> potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, <b>and</b> a bottle <b>of</b> ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles <b>of</b> Old Winyards: a strong red wine from <b>the</b> Southfarthing, <b>and</b> now quite mature, as <b>it</b> had been laid down <b>by</b> Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, <b>and</b> voted him a capital fellow after <b>the</b> first bottle.
<br>   There was plenty <b>of</b> everything left for Frodo. And, <b>of</b> course, all <b>the</b> chief treasures, as well as <b>the</b> books, pictures, <b>and</b> more than enough furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however, <b>no</b> sign nor mention <b>of</b> money <b>or</b> jewellery: not a penny-piece <b>or</b> a glass bead was given away.
<br>   Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that <b>the</b> whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; <b>and</b> before long <b>the</b> place was packed with people who had <b>no</b> business there, <b>but</b> could not be kept out. Labels got torn off <b>and</b> mixed, <b>and</b> quarrels broke out. Some people tried <b>to</b> do swaps <b>and</b> deals in <b>the</b> hall; <b>and</b> others tried <b>to</b> make off with minor items not addressed <b>to</b> them, <b>or</b> with anything that seemed unwanted <b>or</b> unwatched. The road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate was blocked with barrows <b>and</b> handcarts.
<br>   In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commotion <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired for a while <b>and</b> left his friend Merry Brandybuck <b>to</b> keep an eye <b>on</b> things. When Otho loudly demanded <b>to</b> see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.
<br>   “He is indisposed,” he said. “He is resting.”
<br>   “Hiding, you mean,” said Lobelia. “Anyway we want <b>to</b> see him <b>and</b> we mean <b>to</b> see him. Just go <b>and</b> tell him so!”
<br>   Merry left them a long while in <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> they had time <b>to</b> discover their parting gift <b>of</b> spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot <b>of</b> papers in front <b>of</b> him. He looked indisposed—<b>to</b> see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; <b>and</b> he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.
<br>   The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began <b>by</b> offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable <b>and</b> unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only <b>the</b> things specially directed <b>by</b> Bilbo were being given away, they said <b>the</b> whole affair was very fishy.
<br>   “Only one thing is clear <b>to</b> me,” said Otho, “<b>and</b> that is that you are doing exceedingly well out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. I insist <b>on</b> seeing <b>the</b> will.”
<br>   Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir, <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> Frodo. He read <b>the</b> will carefully <b>and</b> snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear <b>and</b> correct (according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legal customs <b>of</b> hobbits, which demand among other things seven signatures <b>of</b> witnesses in red ink).
<br>   “Foiled again!” he said <b>to</b> his wife. “And after waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!” He snapped his fingers under Frodo’s nose <b>and</b> slumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid <b>of</b>. A little later Frodo came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study <b>to</b> see how things were going <b>on</b> <b>and</b> found her still about <b>the</b> place, investigating nooks <b>and</b> comers <b>and</b> tapping <b>the</b> floors. He escorted her firmly off <b>the</b> premises, after he had relieved her <b>of</b> several small (<b>but</b> rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was in <b>the</b> throes <b>of</b> thinking out a really crushing parting remark; <b>but</b> all she found <b>to</b> say, turning round <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step, was:
<br>   “You’ll live <b>to</b> regret <b>it</b>, young fellow! Why didn’t you go too? You don’t belong here; you’re <b>no</b> Baggins—you—you’re a Brandybuck!”
<br>   “Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,” said Frodo as he shut <b>the</b> door <b>on</b> her.
<br>   “It was a compliment,” said Merry Brandybuck, “<b>and</b> so, <b>of</b> course, not true.”
<br>   Then they went round <b>the</b> hole, <b>and</b> evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins <b>and</b> a Bolger) who were knocking holes in <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), who had begun an excavation in <b>the</b> larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend <b>of</b> Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity <b>and</b> hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one’s for <b>the</b> finding—unless <b>the</b> search is interrupted.
<br>   When he had overcome Sancho <b>and</b> pushed him out, Frodo collapsed <b>on</b> a chair in <b>the</b> hall. It’s time <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> shop, Merry,” he said. “Lock <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> don’t open <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.” Then he went <b>to</b> revive himself with a belated cup <b>of</b> tea.
<br>   He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at <b>the</b> front-door. “Lobelia again most likely,” he thought. “She must have thought <b>of</b> something really nasty, <b>and</b> have come back again <b>to</b> say <b>it</b>. It can wait.”
<br>   He went <b>on</b> with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, <b>but</b> he took <b>no</b> notice. Suddenly <b>the</b> wizard’s head appeared at <b>the</b> window.
<br>   “If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole <b>and</b> out through <b>the</b> hill,” he said.
<br>   “My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!” cried Frodo, running out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. “Come in! Come in! I thought <b>it</b> was Lobelia.”
<br>   “Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.”
<br>   “She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried <b>on</b> Bilbo’s ring. I longed <b>to</b> disappear.”
<br>   “Don’t do that!” said Gandalf, sitting down. “Do be careful <b>of</b> that ring, Frodo! In fact, <b>it</b> is partly about that that I have come <b>to</b> say a last word.”
<br>   “Well, what about <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “What do you know already?”
<br>   “Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> how he used <b>it</b>: <b>on</b> his journey, I mean.”
<br>   “Which story, I wonder,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Oh, not what he told <b>the</b> dwarves <b>and</b> put in his book,” said Frodo. “He told me <b>the</b> true story soon after I came <b>to</b> live here. He said you had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. “No secrets between us, Frodo,” he said; “<b>but</b> they are not <b>to</b> go any further. It’s mine anyway.”
<br>   “That’s interesting,” said Gandalf. “Well, what did you think <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all?”
<br>   “If you mean, inventing all that about a “present", well, I thought <b>the</b> true story much more likely, <b>and</b> I couldn’t see <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> altering <b>it</b> at all. It was very unlike Bilbo <b>to</b> do so, anyway; <b>and</b> I thought <b>it</b> rather odd.”
<br>   “So did I. But odd things may happen <b>to</b> people that have such treasures—if they use them. Let <b>it</b> be a warning <b>to</b> you <b>to</b> be very careful with <b>it</b>. It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “I don’t understand,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Neither do I,” answered <b>the</b> wizard. “I have merely begun <b>to</b> wonder about <b>the</b> ring, especially since last night. No need <b>to</b> worry. But if you take my advice you will use <b>it</b> very seldom, <b>or</b> not at all. At least I beg you not <b>to</b> use <b>it</b> in any way that will cause talk <b>or</b> rouse suspicion. I say again: keep <b>it</b> safe, <b>and</b> keep <b>it</b> secret!”
<br>   “You are very mysterious! What are you afraid <b>of</b>?”
<br>   “I am not certain, so I will say <b>no</b> more. I may be able <b>to</b> tell you something when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for <b>the</b> present.” He got up.
<br>   “At once!” cried Frodo. “Why, I thought you were staying <b>on</b> for at least a week. I was looking forward <b>to</b> your help.”
<br>   “I did mean <b>to</b>—<b>but</b> I have had <b>to</b> change my mind. I may be away for a good while; <b>but</b> I’ll come <b>and</b> see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t often be visiting <b>the</b> Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a nuisance <b>and</b> a disturber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace. Some people are actually accusing me <b>of</b> spiriting Bilbo away, <b>or</b> worse. If you want <b>to</b> know, there is supposed <b>to</b> be a plot between you <b>and</b> me <b>to</b> get hold <b>of</b> his wealth.”
<br>   “Some people!” exclaimed Frodo. “You mean Otho <b>and</b> Lobelia. How abominable! I would give them Bag End <b>and</b> everything else, if I could get Bilbo back <b>and</b> go off tramping in <b>the</b> country with him. I love <b>the</b> Shire. But I begin <b>to</b> wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever see him again.”
<br>   “So do I,” said Gandalf. “And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take care <b>of</b> yourself! Look out for me, especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!”
<br>   Frodo saw him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. He gave a final wave <b>of</b> his hand, <b>and</b> walked off at a surprising pace; <b>but</b> Frodo thought <b>the</b> old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing in, <b>and</b> his cloaked figure quickly vanished <b>into</b> <b>the</b> twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>THE SHADOW OF THE PAST
<br>
<br>   The talk did not die down in nine <b>or</b> even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance <b>of</b> Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, <b>and</b> indeed all over <b>the</b> Shire, for a year <b>and</b> a day, <b>and</b> was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; <b>and</b> eventually Mad Baggins, who used <b>to</b> vanish with a bang <b>and</b> a flash <b>and</b> reappear with bags <b>of</b> jewels <b>and</b> gold, became a favourite character <b>of</b> legend <b>and</b> lived <b>on</b> long after all <b>the</b> true events were forgotten.
<br>   But in <b>the</b> meantime, <b>the</b> general opinion in <b>the</b> neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, <b>and</b> had run off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen <b>into</b> a pool <b>or</b> a river <b>and</b> come <b>to</b> a tragic, <b>but</b> hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid <b>on</b> Gandalf.
<br>   “If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he’ll settle down <b>and</b> grow some hobbit-sense,” they said. And <b>to</b> all appearance <b>the</b> wizard did leave Frodo alone, <b>and</b> he did settle down, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began <b>to</b> carry <b>on</b> Bilbo’s reputation for oddity. He refused <b>to</b> go <b>into</b> mourning; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next year he gave a party in honour <b>of</b> Bilbo’s hundred-<b>and</b>-twelfth birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mark, for twenty guests were invited <b>and</b> there were several meals at which <b>it</b> snowed food <b>and</b> rained drink, as hobbits say.
<br>   Some people were rather shocked; <b>but</b> Frodo kept up <b>the</b> custom <b>of</b> giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year after year until they got used <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked: “Where is he then?” he shrugged his shoulders.
<br>   He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; <b>but</b> he had a good many friends, especially among <b>the</b> younger hobbits (mostly descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Took) who had as children been fond <b>of</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> often in <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> Bag End. Folco Boffin <b>and</b> Fredegar Bolger were two <b>of</b> these; <b>but</b> his closest friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), <b>and</b> Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Meriadoc, <b>but</b> that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over <b>the</b> Shire with them; <b>but</b> more often he wandered <b>by</b> himself, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amazement <b>of</b> sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in <b>the</b> hills <b>and</b> woods under <b>the</b> starlight. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin suspected that he visited <b>the</b> Elves at times, as Bilbo had done.
<br>   As time went <b>on</b>, people began <b>to</b> notice that Frodo also showed signs <b>of</b> good “preservation”: outwardly he retained <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> a robust <b>and</b> energetic hobbit just out <b>of</b> his tweens. “Some folk have all <b>the</b> luck,” they said; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was not until Frodo approached <b>the</b> usually more sober age <b>of</b> fifty that they began <b>to</b> think <b>it</b> queer.
<br>   Frodo himself, after <b>the</b> first shock, found that being his own master <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mr. Baggins <b>of</b> Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was quite happy <b>and</b> did not worry much about <b>the</b> future. But half unknown <b>to</b> himself <b>the</b> regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He found himself wondering at times, especially in <b>the</b> autumn, about <b>the</b> wild lands, <b>and</b> strange visions <b>of</b> mountains that he had never seen came <b>into</b> his dreams. He began <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> himself: “Perhaps I shall cross <b>the</b> River myself one day.” To which <b>the</b> other half <b>of</b> his mind always replied: “Not yet.”
<br>   So <b>it</b> went <b>on</b>, until his forties were running out, <b>and</b> his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (<b>or</b> ominous); <b>it</b> was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began <b>to</b> feel restless, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, <b>and</b> wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in <b>the</b> Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took <b>to</b> wandering further afield <b>and</b> more often <b>by</b> himself; <b>and</b> Merry <b>and</b> his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking <b>and</b> talking with <b>the</b> strange wayfarers that began at this time <b>to</b> appear in <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   There were rumours <b>of</b> strange things happening in <b>the</b> world outside; <b>and</b> as Gandalf had not at that time appeared <b>or</b> sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all <b>the</b> news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in <b>the</b> Shire, could now be seen passing westward through <b>the</b> woods in <b>the</b> evening, passing <b>and</b> not returning; <b>but</b> they were leaving Middle-earth <b>and</b> were <b>no</b> longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road in unusual numbers. The ancient East-West Road ran through <b>the</b> Shire <b>to</b> its end at <b>the</b> Grey Havens, <b>and</b> dwarves had always used <b>it</b> <b>on</b> their way <b>to</b> their mines in <b>the</b> Blue Mountains. They were <b>the</b> hobbits” chief source <b>of</b> news from distant parts—if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little <b>and</b> hobbits asked <b>no</b> more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves <b>of</b> far countries, seeking refuge in <b>the</b> West. They were troubled, <b>and</b> some spoke in whispers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   That name <b>the</b> hobbits only knew in legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark past, like a shadow in <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> their memories; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was ominous <b>and</b> disquieting. It seemed that <b>the</b> evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> White Council only <b>to</b> reappear in greater strength in <b>the</b> old strongholds <b>of</b> Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, <b>it</b> was said. From there <b>the</b> power was spreading far <b>and</b> wide, <b>and</b> away far east <b>and</b> south there were wars <b>and</b> growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in <b>the</b> mountains. Trolls were abroad, <b>no</b> longer dull-witted, <b>but</b> cunning <b>and</b> armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints <b>of</b> creatures more terrible than all these, <b>but</b> they had <b>no</b> name.
<br>   Little <b>of</b> all this, <b>of</b> course, reached <b>the</b> ears <b>of</b> ordinary hobbits. But even <b>the</b> deafest <b>and</b> most stay-at-home began <b>to</b> hear queer tales; <b>and</b> those whose business took them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders saw strange things. The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even in <b>the</b> comfortable heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.
<br>   Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> opposite him was Ted Sandyman, <b>the</b> miller’s son; <b>and</b> there were various other rustic hobbits listening <b>to</b> their talk.
<br>   “Queer things you do hear these days, <b>to</b> be sure,” said Sam.
<br>   “Ah,” said Ted, “you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales <b>and</b> children’s stories at home, if I want <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “No doubt you can,” retorted Sam, “<b>and</b> I daresay there’s more truth in some <b>of</b> them than you reckon. Who invented <b>the</b> stories anyway? Take dragons now.”
<br>   “No thank “ee,” said Ted, “I won’t. I heard tell <b>of</b> them when I was a youngster, <b>but</b> there’s <b>no</b> call <b>to</b> believe in them now. There’s only one Dragon in Bywater, <b>and</b> that’s Green,” he said, getting a general laugh.
<br>   “All right,” said Sam, laughing with <b>the</b> rest. “But what about these Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond <b>the</b> North Moors not long back.”
<br>   “Who’s they?”
<br>   “My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill <b>and</b> goes up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northfarthing for <b>the</b> hunting. He saw one.”
<br>   “Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things; <b>and</b> maybe he sees things that ain’t there.”
<br>   “But this one was as big as an elm tree, <b>and</b> walking—walking seven yards <b>to</b> a stride, if <b>it</b> was an inch.”
<br>   “Then I bet <b>it</b> wasn’t an inch. What he saw was an elm tree, as like as not.”
<br>   “But this one was walking, I tell you; <b>and</b> there ain’t <b>no</b> elm tree <b>on</b> <b>the</b> North Moors.”
<br>   “Then Hal can’t have seen one,” said Ted. There was some laughing <b>and</b> clapping: <b>the</b> audience seemed <b>to</b> think that Ted had scored a point.
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same,” said Sam, “you can’t deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing <b>the</b> Shire—crossing <b>it</b>, mind you: there are more that are turned back at <b>the</b> borders. The Bounders have never been so busy before.
<br>   “And I’ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harbours, out away beyond <b>the</b> White Towers.” Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any <b>of</b> them knew how far <b>it</b> was <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea, past <b>the</b> old towers beyond <b>the</b> western borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. But <b>it</b> was an old tradition that away over there stood <b>the</b> Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never <b>to</b> return.
<br>   “They are sailing, sailing, sailing over <b>the</b> Sea, they are going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> leaving us,” said Sam, half chanting <b>the</b> words, shaking his head sadly <b>and</b> solemnly. But Ted laughed.
<br>   “Well, that isn’t anything new, if you believe <b>the</b> old tales. And I don’t see what <b>it</b> matters <b>to</b> me <b>or</b> you. Let them sail! But I warrant you haven’t seen them doing <b>it</b>; nor any one else in <b>the</b> Shire.”
<br>   “Well I don’t know,” said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once seen an Elf in <b>the</b> woods, <b>and</b> still hoped <b>to</b> see more one day. Of all <b>the</b> legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments <b>of</b> tales <b>and</b> half-remembered stories about <b>the</b> Elves as <b>the</b> hobbits knew, had always moved him most deeply. “There are some, even in these parts, as know <b>the</b> Fair Folk <b>and</b> get news <b>of</b> them,” he said. “There’s Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that they were sailing <b>and</b> he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many’s <b>the</b> talk I had with him when I was a little lad.”
<br>   “Oh, they’re both cracked,” said Ted. “Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, <b>and</b> Frodo’s cracking. If that’s where you get your news from, you’ll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, I’m off home. Your good health!” He drained his mug <b>and</b> went out noisily.
<br>   Sam sat silent <b>and</b> said <b>no</b> more. He had a good deal <b>to</b> think about. For one thing, there was a lot <b>to</b> do up in <b>the</b> Bag End garden, <b>and</b> he would have a busy day tomorrow, if <b>the</b> weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But Sam had more <b>on</b> his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, <b>and</b> got up <b>and</b> went out.
<br>   It was early April <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, <b>and</b> a cool pale evening was quietly fading <b>into</b> night. He walked home under <b>the</b> early stars through Hobbiton <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> Hill, whistling softly <b>and</b> thoughtfully.
<br>   It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after <b>the</b> Party he had been away. Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, <b>and</b> after taking a good look at him he went off again. During <b>the</b> next year <b>or</b> two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, <b>and</b> going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business <b>and</b> journeys, <b>and</b> seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo’s health <b>and</b> doings.
<br>   Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo had seen <b>or</b> heard <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> he had begun <b>to</b> think that <b>the</b> wizard would never return <b>and</b> had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as Sam was walking home <b>and</b> twilight was fading, there came <b>the</b> once familiar tap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study window.
<br>   Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise <b>and</b> great delight. They looked hard at one another.
<br>   “Ah well eh?” said Gandalf. “You look <b>the</b> same as ever, Frodo!”
<br>   “So do you,” Frodo replied; <b>but</b> secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older <b>and</b> more careworn. He pressed him for news <b>of</b> himself <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide world, <b>and</b> soon they were deep in talk, <b>and</b> they stayed up far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   Next morning after a late breakfast, <b>the</b> wizard was sitting with Frodo <b>by</b> <b>the</b> open window <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. A bright fire was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sun was warm, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind was in <b>the</b> South. Everything looked fresh, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new green <b>of</b> Spring was shimmering in <b>the</b> fields <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees” fingers.
<br>   Gandalf was thinking <b>of</b> a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out <b>of</b> Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps whiter than <b>it</b> had been then, <b>and</b> his beard <b>and</b> eyebrows were perhaps longer, <b>and</b> his face more lined with care <b>and</b> wisdom; <b>but</b> his eyes were as bright as ever, <b>and</b> he smoked <b>and</b> blew smoke-rings with <b>the</b> same vigour <b>and</b> delight.
<br>   He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought. Even in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> morning he felt <b>the</b> dark shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tidings that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke <b>the</b> silence.
<br>   “Last night you began <b>to</b> tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,” he said. “And then you stopped, because you said that such matters were best left until daylight. Don’t you think you had better finish now? You say <b>the</b> ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what way?”
<br>   “In many ways,” answered <b>the</b> wizard. It is far more powerful than I ever dared <b>to</b> think at first, so powerful that in <b>the</b> end <b>it</b> would utterly overcome anyone <b>of</b> mortal race who possessed <b>it</b>. It would possess him.
<br>   “In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, <b>and</b> they were, <b>of</b> course, <b>of</b> various kinds: some more potent <b>and</b> some less. The lesser rings were only essays in <b>the</b> craft before <b>it</b> was full-grown, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elven-smiths they were <b>but</b> trifles—yet still <b>to</b> my mind dangerous for mortals. But <b>the</b> Great Rings, <b>the</b> Rings <b>of</b> Power, they were perilous.
<br>   “A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Rings, does not die, <b>but</b> he does not grow <b>or</b> obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in <b>the</b> end invisible permanently, <b>and</b> walks in <b>the</b> twilight under <b>the</b> eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark power that rules <b>the</b> Rings. Yes, sooner <b>or</b> later—later, if he is strong <b>or</b> well-meaning <b>to</b> begin with, <b>but</b> neither strength nor good purpose will last—sooner <b>or</b> later <b>the</b> dark power will devour him.”
<br>   “How terrifying!” said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound <b>of</b> Sam Gamgee cutting <b>the</b> lawn came in from <b>the</b> garden.
<br>   “How long have you known this?” asked Frodo at length. “And how much did Bilbo know?”
<br>   “Bilbo knew <b>no</b> more than he told you, I am sure,” said Gandalf. “He would certainly never have passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> you anything that he thought would be a danger, even though I promised <b>to</b> look after you. He thought <b>the</b> ring was very beautiful, <b>and</b> very useful at need; <b>and</b> if anything was wrong <b>or</b> queer, <b>it</b> was himself. He said that <b>it</b> was “growing <b>on</b> his mind”, <b>and</b> he was always worrying about <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> he did not suspect that <b>the</b> ring itself was <b>to</b> blame. Though he had found out that <b>the</b> thing needed looking after; <b>it</b> did not seem always <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same size <b>or</b> weight; <b>it</b> shrank <b>or</b> expanded in an odd way, <b>and</b> might suddenly slip off a finger where <b>it</b> had been tight.”
<br>   “Yes, he warned me <b>of</b> that in his last letter,” said Frodo, “so I have always kept <b>it</b> <b>on</b> its chain.”
<br>   “Very wise,” said Gandalf. “But as for his long life, Bilbo never connected <b>it</b> with <b>the</b> ring at all. He took all <b>the</b> credit for that <b>to</b> himself, <b>and</b> he was very proud <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Though he was getting restless <b>and</b> uneasy. Thin <b>and</b> stretched he said. A sign that <b>the</b> ring was getting control.”
<br>   “How long have you known all this?” asked Frodo again.
<br>   “Known?” said Gandalf. “I have known much that only <b>the</b> Wise know, Frodo. But if you mean “known about this ring”, well, I still do not know, one might say. There is a last test <b>to</b> make. But I <b>no</b> longer doubt my guess.
<br>   “When did I first begin <b>to</b> guess?” he mused, searching back in memory. “Let me see—<b>it</b> was in <b>the</b> year that <b>the</b> White Council drove <b>the</b> dark power from Mirkwood, just before <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow fell <b>on</b> my heart then, though I did not know yet what I feared. I wondered often how Gollum came <b>by</b> a Great Ring, as plainly <b>it</b> was—that at least was clear from <b>the</b> first. Then I heard Bilbo’s strange story <b>of</b> how he had “won” <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> I could not believe <b>it</b>. When I at last got <b>the</b> truth out <b>of</b> him, I saw at once that he had been trying <b>to</b> put his claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his “birthday present”. The lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly <b>the</b> ring had an unwholesome power that set <b>to</b> work <b>on</b> its keeper at once. That was <b>the</b> first real warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused; <b>but</b> he resented <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> soon got angry. There was little else that I could do. I could not take <b>it</b> from him without doing greater harm; <b>and</b> I had <b>no</b> right <b>to</b> do so anyway. I could only watch <b>and</b> wait. I might perhaps have consulted Saruman <b>the</b> White, <b>but</b> something always held me back.”
<br>   “Who is he?” asked Frodo. I have never heard <b>of</b> him before.”
<br>   “Maybe not,” answered Gandalf. “Hobbits are, <b>or</b> were, <b>no</b> concern <b>of</b> his. Yet he is great among <b>the</b> Wise. He is <b>the</b> chief <b>of</b> my order <b>and</b> <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council. His knowledge is deep, <b>but</b> his pride has grown with <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> he takes ill any meddling. The lore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-rings, great <b>and</b> small, is his province. He has long studied <b>it</b>, seeking <b>the</b> lost secrets <b>of</b> their making; <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> Rings were debated in <b>the</b> Council, all that he would reveal <b>to</b> us <b>of</b> his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept—<b>but</b> uneasily. Still I watched <b>and</b> I waited.
<br>   “And all seemed well with Bilbo. And <b>the</b> years passed. Yes, they passed, <b>and</b> they seemed not <b>to</b> touch him. He showed <b>no</b> signs <b>of</b> age. The shadow fell <b>on</b> me again. But I said <b>to</b> myself: “After all he comes <b>of</b> a long-lived family <b>on</b> his mother’s side. There is time yet. Wait!”
<br>   “And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said <b>and</b> did things then that filled me with a fear that <b>no</b> words <b>of</b> Saruman could allay. I knew at last that something dark <b>and</b> deadly was at work. And I have spent most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> years since then in finding out <b>the</b> truth <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “There wasn’t any permanent harm done, was there?” asked Frodo anxiously. “He would get all right in time, wouldn’t he? Be able <b>to</b> rest in peace, I mean?”
<br>   “He felt better at once,” said Gandalf. “But there is only one Power in this world that knows all about <b>the</b> Rings <b>and</b> their effects; <b>and</b> as far as I know there is <b>no</b> Power in <b>the</b> world that knows all about hobbits. Among <b>the</b> Wise I am <b>the</b> only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>but</b> full <b>of</b> surprises. Soft as butter they can be, <b>and</b> yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. I think <b>it</b> likely that some would resist <b>the</b> Rings far longer than most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise would believe. I don’t think you need worry about Bilbo.
<br>   “Of course, he possessed <b>the</b> ring for many years, <b>and</b> used <b>it</b>, so <b>it</b> might take a long while for <b>the</b> influence <b>to</b> wear off—before <b>it</b> was safe for him <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live <b>on</b> for years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with <b>it</b>. For he gave <b>it</b> up in <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his own accord: an important point. No, I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let <b>the</b> thing go. It is for you that I feel responsible.
<br>   “Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, <b>and</b> about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world, if <b>the</b> Dark Power overcame <b>the</b> Shire; if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest, not <b>to</b> mention <b>the</b> ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.”
<br>   Frodo shuddered. “But why should we be?” he asked. “And why should he want such slaves?”
<br>   “To tell you <b>the</b> truth,” replied Gandalf, “I believe that hitherto—hitherto, mark you—he has entirely overlooked <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> hobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you—he has many more useful servants—<b>but</b> he won’t forget you again. And hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy <b>and</b> free. There is such a thing as malice <b>and</b> revenge.”
<br>   “Revenge?” said Frodo. “Revenge for what? I still don’t understand what all this has <b>to</b> do with Bilbo <b>and</b> myself, <b>and</b> our ring.”
<br>   “It has everything <b>to</b> do with <b>it</b>,” said Gandalf. “You do not know <b>the</b> real peril yet; <b>but</b> you shall. I was not sure <b>of</b> <b>it</b> myself when I was last here; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> time has come <b>to</b> speak. Give me <b>the</b> ring for a moment.”
<br>   Frodo took <b>it</b> from his breeches-pocket, where <b>it</b> was clasped <b>to</b> a chain that hung from his belt. He unfastened <b>it</b> <b>and</b> handed <b>it</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either <b>it</b> <b>or</b> Frodo himself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf <b>to</b> touch <b>it</b>.
<br>   Gandalf held <b>it</b> up. It looked <b>to</b> be made <b>of</b> pure <b>and</b> solid gold. “Can you see any markings <b>on</b> <b>it</b>?” he asked.
<br>   “No,” said Frodo. “There are none. It is quite plain, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> never shows a scratch <b>or</b> sign <b>of</b> wear.”
<br>   “Well then, look!” To Frodo’s astonishment <b>and</b> distress <b>the</b> wizard threw <b>it</b> suddenly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> a glowing corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. Frodo gave a cry <b>and</b> groped for <b>the</b> tongs; <b>but</b> Gandalf held him back.
<br>   “Wait!” he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows.
<br>   No apparent change came over <b>the</b> ring. After a while Gandalf got up, closed <b>the</b> shutters outside <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> drew <b>the</b> curtains. The room became dark <b>and</b> silent, though <b>the</b> clack <b>of</b> Sam’s shears, now nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> windows, could still be heard faintly from <b>the</b> garden. For a moment <b>the</b> wizard stood looking at <b>the</b> fire; then he stooped <b>and</b> removed <b>the</b> ring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hearth with <b>the</b> tongs, <b>and</b> at once picked <b>it</b> up. Frodo gasped.
<br>   It is quite cool,” said Gandalf. “Take <b>it</b>!” Frodo received <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his shrinking palm: <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> have become thicker <b>and</b> heavier than ever.
<br>   “Hold <b>it</b> up!” said Gandalf. “And look closely!”
<br>   As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than <b>the</b> finest pen-strokes, running along <b>the</b> ring, outside <b>and</b> inside: lines <b>of</b> fire that seemed <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> letters <b>of</b> a flowing script. They shone piercingly bright, <b>and</b> yet remote, as if out <b>of</b> a great depth.
<br>   
<br>   I cannot read <b>the</b> fiery letters,” said Frodo in a quavering voice.
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf, “<b>but</b> I can. The letters are Elvish, <b>of</b> an ancient mode, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> language is that <b>of</b> Mordor, which I will not utter here. But this in <b>the</b> Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:
<br>   
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all, One Ring <b>to</b> find them,
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> bring them all <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> darkness bind them.
<br>   
<br>   It is only two lines <b>of</b> a verse long known in Elven-lore:
<br>   
<br>Three Rings for <b>the</b> Elven-kings under <b>the</b> sky,
<br>Seven for <b>the</b> Dwarf-lords in their halls <b>of</b> stone,
<br>   Nine for Mortal Men doomed <b>to</b> die,
<br>   One for <b>the</b> Dark Lord <b>on</b> his dark throne
<br>   In <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor where <b>the</b> Shadows lie.
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all. One Ring <b>to</b> find them,
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> bring them all <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> darkness bind them
<br>   In <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor where <b>the</b> Shadows lie.”
<br>   
<br>   He paused, <b>and</b> then said slowly in a deep voice: “This is <b>the</b> Master-ring, <b>the</b> One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all. This is <b>the</b> One Ring that he lost many ages ago, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great weakening <b>of</b> his power. He greatly desires <b>it</b>—<b>but</b> he must not get <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Frodo sat silent <b>and</b> motionless. Fear seemed <b>to</b> stretch out a vast hand, like a dark cloud rising in <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> looming up <b>to</b> engulf him. “This ring!” he stammered. “How, how <b>on</b> earth did <b>it</b> come <b>to</b> me?”
<br>   “Ah!” said Gandalf. “That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back in <b>the</b> Black Years, which only <b>the</b> lore-masters now remember. If I were <b>to</b> tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when Spring had passed <b>into</b> Winter.
<br>   “But last night I told you <b>of</b> Sauron <b>the</b> Great, <b>the</b> Dark Lord. The rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again <b>and</b> left his hold in Mirkwood <b>and</b> returned <b>to</b> his ancient fastness in <b>the</b> Dark Tower <b>of</b> Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard <b>of</b>, like a shadow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> old stories. Always after a defeat <b>and</b> a respite, <b>the</b> Shadow takes another shape <b>and</b> grows again.”
<br>   “I wish <b>it</b> need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo.
<br>   “So do I,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> so do all who live <b>to</b> see such times. But that is not for them <b>to</b> decide. All we have <b>to</b> decide is what <b>to</b> do with <b>the</b> time that is given, us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning <b>to</b> look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from ripe, I think, <b>but</b> they are ripening. We shall be hard put <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. We should be very hard put <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, even if <b>it</b> were not for this dreadful chance.
<br>   “The Enemy still lacks one thing <b>to</b> give him strength <b>and</b> knowledge <b>to</b> beat down all resistance, break <b>the</b> last defences, <b>and</b> cover all <b>the</b> lands in a second darkness. He lacks <b>the</b> One Ring.
<br>   “The Three, fairest <b>of</b> all, <b>the</b> Elf-lords hid from him, <b>and</b> his hand never touched them <b>or</b> sullied them. Seven <b>the</b> Dwarf-kings possessed, <b>but</b> three he has recovered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others <b>the</b> dragons have consumed. Nine he gave <b>to</b> Mortal Men, proud <b>and</b> great, <b>and</b> so ensnared them. Long ago they fell under <b>the</b> dominion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> One, <b>and</b> they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since <b>the</b> Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As <b>the</b> Shadow grows once more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak <b>of</b> such things even in <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> is now: <b>the</b> Nine he has gathered <b>to</b> himself; <b>the</b> Seven also, <b>or</b> else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that <b>no</b> longer troubles him. He only needs <b>the</b> One; for he made that Ring himself, <b>it</b> is his, <b>and</b> he let a great part <b>of</b> his own former power pass <b>into</b> <b>it</b>, so that he could rule all <b>the</b> others. If he recovers <b>it</b>, then he will command them all again, wherever they be, even <b>the</b> Three, <b>and</b> all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, <b>and</b> he will be stronger than ever.
<br>   “And this is <b>the</b> dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that <b>the</b> One had perished; that <b>the</b> Elves had destroyed <b>it</b>, as should have been done. But he knows now that <b>it</b> has not perished, that <b>it</b> has been found. So he is seeking <b>it</b>, seeking <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> all his thought is bent <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. It is his great hope <b>and</b> our great fear.”
<br>   “Why, why wasn’t <b>it</b> destroyed?” cried Frodo. “And how did <b>the</b> Enemy ever come <b>to</b> lose <b>it</b>, if he was so strong, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was so precious <b>to</b> him?” He clutched <b>the</b> Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out <b>to</b> seize <b>it</b>.
<br>   “It was taken from him,” said Gandalf. “The strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>to</b> resist him was greater long ago; <b>and</b> not all Men were estranged from them. The Men <b>of</b> Westernesse came <b>to</b> their aid. That is a chapter <b>of</b> ancient history which <b>it</b> might be good <b>to</b> recall; for there was sorrow then too, <b>and</b> gathering dark, <b>but</b> great valour, <b>and</b> great deeds that were not wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I will tell you all <b>the</b> tale, <b>or</b> you shall hear <b>it</b> told in full <b>by</b> one who knows <b>it</b> best.
<br>   “But for <b>the</b> moment, since most <b>of</b> all you need <b>to</b> know how this thing came <b>to</b> you, <b>and</b> that will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It was Gil-galad, Elven-king <b>and</b> Elendil <b>of</b> Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, though they themselves perished in <b>the</b> deed; <b>and</b> Isildur Elendil’s son cut <b>the</b> Ring from Sauron’s hand <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> for his own. Then Sauron was vanquished <b>and</b> his spirit fled <b>and</b> was hidden for long years, until his shadow took shape again in Mirkwood.
<br>   “But <b>the</b> Ring was lost. It fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Great River, Anduin, <b>and</b> vanished. For Isildur was marching north along <b>the</b> east banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> near <b>the</b> Gladden Fields he was waylaid <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Orcs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> almost all his folk were slain. He leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waters, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> Orcs saw him <b>and</b> killed him with arrows.”
<br>   Gandalf paused. “And there in <b>the</b> dark pools amid <b>the</b> Gladden Fields,” he said, “<b>the</b> Ring passed out <b>of</b> knowledge <b>and</b> legend; <b>and</b> even so much <b>of</b> its history is known now only <b>to</b> a few, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise could discover <b>no</b> more. But at last I can carry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> story, I think.
<br>   “Long after, <b>but</b> still very long ago, there lived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> Wilderland a clever-handed <b>and</b> quiet-footed little people. I guess they were <b>of</b> hobbit-kind; akin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stoors, for they loved <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> often swam in <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> made little boats <b>of</b> reeds. There was among them a family <b>of</b> high repute, for <b>it</b> was large <b>and</b> wealthier than most, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was ruled <b>by</b> a grandmother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk, stern <b>and</b> wise in old lore, such as they had. The most inquisitive <b>and</b> curious-minded <b>of</b> that family was called Sm?agol. He was interested in roots <b>and</b> beginnings; he dived <b>into</b> deep pools; he burrowed under trees <b>and</b> growing plants; he tunnelled <b>into</b> green mounds; <b>and</b> he ceased <b>to</b> look up at <b>the</b> hill-tops, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>on</b> trees, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> flowers opening in <b>the</b> air: his head <b>and</b> his eyes were downward.
<br>   “He had a friend called D?agol, <b>of</b> similar sort, sharper-eyed <b>but</b> not so quick <b>and</b> strong. On a time they took a boat <b>and</b> went down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields, where there were great beds <b>of</b> iris <b>and</b> flowering reeds. There Sm?agol got out <b>and</b> went nosing about <b>the</b> banks <b>but</b> D?agol sat in <b>the</b> boat <b>and</b> fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, <b>and</b> before he knew where he was, he was dragged out <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom. Then he let go <b>of</b> his line, for he thought he saw something shining in <b>the</b> river-bed; <b>and</b> holding his breath he grabbed at <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair <b>and</b> a handful <b>of</b> mud; <b>and</b> he swam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank. And behold! when he washed <b>the</b> mud away, there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> shone <b>and</b> glittered in <b>the</b> sun, so that his heart was glad. But Sm?agol had been watching him from behind a tree, <b>and</b> as D?agol gloated over <b>the</b> ring, Sm?agol came softly up behind.
<br>   ““Give us that, D?agol, my love,” said Sm?agol, over his friend’s shoulder.
<br>   ““Why?” said D?agol.
<br>   ““Because <b>it</b>’s my birthday, my love, <b>and</b> I wants <b>it</b>,” said Sm?agol.
<br>   ““I don’t care,” said D?agol. “I have given you a present already, more than I could afford. I found this, <b>and</b> I’m going <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b>.”
<br>   ““Oh, are you indeed, my love,” said Sm?agol; <b>and</b> he caught D?agol <b>by</b> <b>the</b> throat <b>and</b> strangled him, because <b>the</b> gold looked so bright <b>and</b> beautiful. Then he put <b>the</b> ring <b>on</b> his finger.
<br>   “No one ever found out what had become <b>of</b> D?agol; he was murdered far from home, <b>and</b> his body was cunningly hidden. But Sm?agol returned alone; <b>and</b> he found that none <b>of</b> his family could see him, when he was wearing <b>the</b> ring. He was very pleased with his discovery <b>and</b> he concealed <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> he used <b>it</b> <b>to</b> find out secrets, <b>and</b> he put his knowledge <b>to</b> crooked <b>and</b> malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed <b>and</b> keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had given him power according <b>to</b> his stature. It is not <b>to</b> be wondered at that he became very unpopular <b>and</b> was shunned (when visible) <b>by</b> all his relations. They kicked him, <b>and</b> he bit their feet. He took <b>to</b> thieving, <b>and</b> going about muttering <b>to</b> himself, <b>and</b> gurgling in his throat. So they called him Gollum, <b>and</b> cursed him, <b>and</b> told him <b>to</b> go far away; <b>and</b> his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from <b>the</b> family <b>and</b> turned him out <b>of</b> her hole.
<br>   “He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>and</b> he journeyed up <b>the</b> River, till he came <b>to</b> a stream that flowed down from <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers <b>and</b> ate them raw. One day <b>it</b> was very hot, <b>and</b> as he was bending over a pool, he felt a burning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> his head) <b>and</b> a dazzling light from <b>the</b> water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at <b>it</b>, for he had almost forgotten about <b>the</b> Sun. Then for <b>the</b> last time he looked up <b>and</b> shook his fist at her.
<br>   “But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, out <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> stream came. And he thought suddenly: “It would be cool <b>and</b> shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. The roots <b>of</b> those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since <b>the</b> beginning.”
<br>   “So he journeyed <b>by</b> night up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> highlands, <b>and</b> he found a little cave out <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> dark stream ran; <b>and</b> he wormed his way like a maggot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> vanished out <b>of</b> all knowledge. The Ring went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows with him, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> maker, when his power had begun <b>to</b> grow again, could learn nothing <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Gollum!” cried Frodo. “Gollum? Do you mean that this is <b>the</b> very Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!”
<br>   “I think <b>it</b> is a sad story,” said <b>the</b> wizard, “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> might have happened <b>to</b> others, even <b>to</b> some hobbits that I have known.”
<br>   “I can’t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,” said Frodo with some heat. “What an abominable notion!”
<br>   “It is true all <b>the</b> same,” replied Gandalf. “About their origins, at any rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo’s story suggests <b>the</b> kinship. There was a great deal in <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> their minds <b>and</b> memories that was very similar. They understood one another remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a Dwarf, <b>or</b> an Orc, <b>or</b> even an Elf. Think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riddles they both knew, for one thing.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Frodo. “Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> much <b>the</b> same sort. And hobbits don’t cheat. Gollum meant <b>to</b> cheat all <b>the</b> time. He was just trying <b>to</b> put poor Bilbo off his guard. And I daresay <b>it</b> amused his wickedness <b>to</b> start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim, <b>but</b> if he lost would not hurt him.”
<br>   “Only too true, I fear,” said Gandalf. “But there was something else in <b>it</b>, I think, which you don’t see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He had proved tougher than even one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise would have guessed -as a hobbit might. There was a little corner <b>of</b> his mind that was still his own, <b>and</b> light came through <b>it</b>, as through a chink in <b>the</b> dark: light out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. It was actually pleasant, I think, <b>to</b> hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories <b>of</b> wind, <b>and</b> trees, <b>and</b> sun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> such forgotten things.
<br>   “But that, <b>of</b> course, would only make <b>the</b> evil part <b>of</b> him angrier in <b>the</b> end—unless <b>it</b> could be conquered. Unless <b>it</b> could be cured.” Gandalf sighed. “Alas! there is little hope <b>of</b> that for him. Yet not <b>no</b> hope. No, not though he possessed <b>the</b> Ring so long, almost as far back as he can remember. For <b>it</b> was long since he had worn <b>it</b> much: in <b>the</b> black darkness <b>it</b> was seldom needed. Certainly he had never “faded”. He is thin <b>and</b> tough still. But <b>the</b> thing was eating up his mind, <b>of</b> course, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> torment had become almost unbearable.
<br>   “All <b>the</b> “great secrets” under <b>the</b> mountains had turned out <b>to</b> be just empty night: there was nothing more <b>to</b> find out, nothing worth doing, only nasty furtive eating <b>and</b> resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched. He hated <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> he hated light more: he hated everything, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring most <b>of</b> all.”
<br>   “What do you mean?” said Frodo. “Surely <b>the</b> Ring was his precious <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only thing he cared for? But if he hated <b>it</b>, why didn’t he get rid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> go away <b>and</b> leave <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “You ought <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,” said Gandalf. “He hated <b>it</b> <b>and</b> loved <b>it</b>, as he hated <b>and</b> loved himself. He could not get rid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. He had <b>no</b> will left in <b>the</b> matter.
<br>   “A Ring <b>of</b> Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off treacherously, <b>but</b> its keeper never abandons <b>it</b>. At most he plays with <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> handing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> someone else’s care—<b>and</b> that only at an early stage, when <b>it</b> first begins <b>to</b> grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing, <b>and</b> really done <b>it</b>. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> cast <b>it</b> aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Ring itself that decided things. The Ring left him.”
<br>   “What, just in time <b>to</b> meet Bilbo?” said Frodo. “Wouldn’t an Orc have suited <b>it</b> better?”
<br>   “It is <b>no</b> laughing matter,” said Gandalf. “Not for you. It was <b>the</b> strangest event in <b>the</b> whole history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring so far: Bilbo’s arrival just at that time, <b>and</b> putting his hand <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, blindly, in <b>the</b> dark.
<br>   “There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying <b>to</b> get back <b>to</b> its master. It had slipped from Isildur’s hand <b>and</b> betrayed him; then when a chance came <b>it</b> caught poor D?agol, <b>and</b> he was murdered; <b>and</b> after that Gollum, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> had devoured him. It could make <b>no</b> further use <b>of</b> him: he was too small <b>and</b> mean; <b>and</b> as long as <b>it</b> stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more <b>and</b> sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, <b>it</b> abandoned Gollum. Only <b>to</b> be picked up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from <b>the</b> Shire!
<br>   “Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring-maker. I can put <b>it</b> <b>no</b> plainer than <b>by</b> saying that Bilbo was meant <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> not <b>by</b> its maker. In which case you also were meant <b>to</b> have <b>it</b>. And that maybe an encouraging thought.”
<br>   “It is not,” said Frodo. “Though I am not sure that I understand you. But how have you learned all this about <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> about Gollum? Do you really know <b>it</b> all, <b>or</b> are you just guessing still?”
<br>   Gandalf looked at Frodo, <b>and</b> his eyes glinted. I knew much <b>and</b> I have learned much,” he answered. “But I am not going <b>to</b> give an account <b>of</b> all my doings <b>to</b> you. The history <b>of</b> Elendil <b>and</b> Isildur <b>and</b> <b>the</b> One Ring is known <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> Wise. Your ring is shown <b>to</b> be that One Ring <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire-writing alone, apart from any other evidence.” “And when did you discover that?” asked Frodo, interrupting. “Just now in this room, <b>of</b> course,” answered <b>the</b> wizard sharply. “But I expected <b>to</b> find <b>it</b>. I have come back from dark journeys <b>and</b> long search <b>to</b> make that final test. It is <b>the</b> last proof, <b>and</b> all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum’s part, <b>and</b> fitting <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gap in <b>the</b> history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses about Gollum, <b>but</b> I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.”
<br>   “You have seen Gollum?” exclaimed Frodo in amazement.
<br>   “Yes. The obvious thing <b>to</b> do, <b>of</b> course, if one could. I tried long ago; <b>but</b> I have managed <b>it</b> at last.”
<br>   “Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?”
<br>   “Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing <b>to</b> tell—though not, <b>of</b> course, in <b>the</b> way I have reported <b>it</b>. Gollum is a liar, <b>and</b> you have <b>to</b> sift his words. For instance, he called <b>the</b> Ring his “birthday present”, <b>and</b> he stuck <b>to</b> that. He said <b>it</b> came from his grandmother, who had lots <b>of</b> beautiful things <b>of</b> that kind. A ridiculous story. I have <b>no</b> doubt that Sm?agol's grandmother was a matriarch, a great person in her way, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> talk <b>of</b> her possessing many Elven-rings was absurd, <b>and</b> as for giving them away, <b>it</b> was a lie. But a lie with a grain <b>of</b> truth.
<br>   “The murder <b>of</b> D?agol haunted Gollum, <b>and</b> he had made up a defence, repeating <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his “precious” over <b>and</b> over again, as he gnawed bones in <b>the</b> dark, until he almost believed <b>it</b>. It was his birthday. D?agol ought <b>to</b> have given <b>the</b> ring <b>to</b> him. It had previously turned up just so as <b>to</b> be a present. It was his birthday present, <b>and</b> so <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> <b>on</b>.
<br>   “I endured him as long as I could, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> truth was desperately important, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> end I had <b>to</b> be harsh. I put <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> fire <b>on</b> him, <b>and</b> wrung <b>the</b> true story out <b>of</b> him, bit <b>by</b> bit, together with much snivelling <b>and</b> snarling. He thought he was misunderstood <b>and</b> ill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riddle-game <b>and</b> Bilbo’s escape, he would not say any more, except in dark hints. Some other fear was <b>on</b> him greater than mine. He muttered that he was going <b>to</b> gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, <b>and</b> driven <b>into</b> a hole <b>and</b> then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good friends <b>and</b> very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for <b>it</b>. That was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo <b>and</b> cursed his name. What is more, he knew where he came from.”
<br>   “But how did he find that out?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “Well, as for <b>the</b> name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; <b>and</b> after that <b>it</b> would not be difficult <b>to</b> discover his country, once Gollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for <b>the</b> Ring proved stronger than his fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orcs, <b>or</b> even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light. After a year <b>or</b> two he left <b>the</b> mountains. You see, though still bound <b>by</b> desire <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>the</b> Ring was <b>no</b> longer devouring him; he began <b>to</b> revive a little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, <b>and</b> he was mortally hungry.
<br>   “Light, light <b>of</b> Sun <b>and</b> Moon, he still feared <b>and</b> hated, <b>and</b> he always will, I think; <b>but</b> he was cunning. He found he could hide from daylight <b>and</b> moonshine, <b>and</b> make his way swiftly <b>and</b> softly <b>by</b> dead <b>of</b> night with his pale cold eyes, <b>and</b> catch small frightened <b>or</b> unwary things. He grew stronger <b>and</b> bolder with new food <b>and</b> new air. He found his way <b>into</b> Mirkwood, as one would expect.”
<br>   “Is that where you found him?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “I saw him there,” answered Gandalf, “<b>but</b> before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail. It was difficult <b>to</b> learn anything from him for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted <b>by</b> curses <b>and</b> threats. “What had <b>it</b> got in its pocketses?” he said. “It wouldn’t say, <b>no</b> precious. Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, <b>it</b> did. It broke <b>the</b> rules. We ought <b>to</b> have squeezed <b>it</b>, yes precious. And we will, precious!”
<br>   “That is a sample <b>of</b> his talk. I don’t suppose you want any more. I had weary days <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. But from hints dropped among <b>the</b> snarls I even gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last <b>to</b> Esgaroth, <b>and</b> even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> streets <b>of</b> Dale, listening secretly <b>and</b> peering. Well, <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great events went far <b>and</b> wide in Wilderland, <b>and</b> many had heard Bilbo’s name <b>and</b> knew where he came from. We had made <b>no</b> secret <b>of</b> our return journey <b>to</b> his home in <b>the</b> West. Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.”
<br>   “Then why didn’t he track Bilbo further?” asked Frodo. “Why didn’t he come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire?”
<br>   “Ah,” said Gandalf, “now we come <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. I think Gollum tried <b>to</b>. He set out <b>and</b> came back westward, as far as <b>the</b> Great River. But then he turned aside. He was not daunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me.
<br>   “The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood <b>and</b> back again <b>it</b> led them, though they never caught him. The wood was full <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rumour <b>of</b> him, dreadful tales even among beasts <b>and</b> birds. The Woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees <b>to</b> find nests; <b>it</b> crept <b>into</b> holes <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> young; <b>it</b> slipped through windows <b>to</b> find cradles.
<br>   “But at <b>the</b> western edge <b>of</b> Mirkwood <b>the</b> trail turned away. It wandered off southwards <b>and</b> passed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wood-elves” ken, <b>and</b> was lost. And then I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, <b>and</b> not <b>the</b> first; though I fear <b>it</b> may prove <b>the</b> worst. I let <b>the</b> matter be. I let him go; for I had much else <b>to</b> think <b>of</b> at that time, <b>and</b> I still trusted <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> Saruman.
<br>   “Well, that was years ago. I have paid for <b>it</b> since with many dark <b>and</b> dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took <b>it</b> up again, after Bilbo left here. And my search would have been in vain, <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> help that I had from a friend: Aragorn, <b>the</b> greatest traveller <b>and</b> huntsman <b>of</b> this age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Together we sought for Gollum down <b>the</b> whole length <b>of</b> Wilderland, without hope, <b>and</b> without success. But at last, when I had given up <b>the</b> chase <b>and</b> turned <b>to</b> other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great perils bringing <b>the</b> miserable creature with him.
<br>   “What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept <b>and</b> called us cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; <b>and</b> when we pressed him he whined <b>and</b> cringed, <b>and</b> rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is <b>no</b> possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step <b>by</b> step, mile <b>by</b> mile, south, down at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor.”
<br>   A heavy silence fell in <b>the</b> room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. Even outside everything seemed still. No sound <b>of</b> Sam’s shears could now be heard.
<br>   “Yes, <b>to</b> Mordor,” said Gandalf. “Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dark Power was bending all its will <b>to</b> gather them there. The Ring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summons. And all folk were whispering then <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Shadow in <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> its hatred <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his revenge!
<br>   “Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort. And sooner <b>or</b> later as he lurked <b>and</b> pried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders he would be caught, <b>and</b> taken—for examination. That was <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, I fear. When he was found he had already been there long, <b>and</b> was <b>on</b> his way back. On some errand <b>of</b> mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief was done.
<br>   “Yes, alas! through him <b>the</b> Enemy has learned that <b>the</b> One has been found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his ring. He knows that <b>it</b> is a Great Ring, for <b>it</b> gave long life. He knows that <b>it</b> is not one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three, for they have never been lost, <b>and</b> they endure <b>no</b> evil. He knows that <b>it</b> is not one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seven, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Nine, for they are accounted for. He knows that <b>it</b> is <b>the</b> One. And he has at last heard, I think, <b>of</b> hobbits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   “The Shire—he may be seeking for <b>it</b> now, if he has not already found out where <b>it</b> lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that <b>the</b> long-unnoticed name <b>of</b> Baggins has become important.”
<br>   “But this is terrible!” cried Frodo. “Far worse than <b>the</b> worst that I imagined from your hints <b>and</b> warnings. O Gandalf, best <b>of</b> friends, what am I <b>to</b> do? For now I am really afraid. What am I <b>to</b> do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!”
<br>   “Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, <b>and</b> Mercy: not <b>to</b> strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from <b>the</b> evil, <b>and</b> escaped in <b>the</b> end, because he began his ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring so. With Pity.”
<br>   “I am sorry,” said Frodo. “But I am frightened; <b>and</b> I do not feel any pity for Gollum.”
<br>   “You have not seen him,” Gandalf broke in.
<br>   “No, <b>and</b> I don’t want <b>to</b>,” said Frodo. I can’t understand you. Do you mean <b>to</b> say that you, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves, have let him live <b>on</b> after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, <b>and</b> just an enemy. He deserves death.”
<br>   “Deserves <b>it</b>! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them? Then do not be too eager <b>to</b> deal out death in judgement. For even <b>the</b> very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, <b>but</b> there is a chance <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. And he is bound up with <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part <b>to</b> play yet, for good <b>or</b> ill, before <b>the</b> end; <b>and</b> when that comes, <b>the</b> pity <b>of</b> Bilbo may rule <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> many—yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old <b>and</b> very wretched. The Wood-elves have him in prison, <b>but</b> they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.”
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same,” said Frodo, “even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept <b>the</b> Ring. I wish he had never found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> that I had not got <b>it</b>! Why did you let me keep <b>it</b>? Why didn’t you make me throw <b>it</b> away, <b>or</b>, <b>or</b> destroy <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “Let you? Make you?” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Haven’t you been listening <b>to</b> all that I have said? You are not thinking <b>of</b> what you are saying. But as for throwing <b>it</b> away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings have a way <b>of</b> being found. In evil hands <b>it</b> might have done great evil. Worst <b>of</b> all, <b>it</b> might have fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Indeed <b>it</b> certainly would; for this is <b>the</b> One, <b>and</b> he is exerting all his power <b>to</b> find <b>it</b> <b>or</b> draw <b>it</b> <b>to</b> himself.
<br>   “Of course, my dear Frodo, <b>it</b> was dangerous for you; <b>and</b> that has troubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had <b>to</b> take some risk—though even when I was far away there has never been a day when <b>the</b> Shire has not been guarded <b>by</b> watchful eyes. As long as you never used <b>it</b>, I did not think that <b>the</b> Ring would have any lasting effect <b>on</b> you, not for evil, not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.”
<br>   “But why not destroy <b>it</b>, as you say should have been done long ago?” cried Frodo again. If you had warned me, <b>or</b> even sent me a message, I would have done away with <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?”
<br>   “No. But I suppose one could hammer <b>it</b> <b>or</b> melt <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Try!” said Gandalf. Try now!”
<br>   Frodo drew <b>the</b> Ring out <b>of</b> his pocket again <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b>. It now appeared plain <b>and</b> smooth, without mark <b>or</b> device that he could see. The gold looked very fair <b>and</b> pure, <b>and</b> Frodo thought how rich <b>and</b> beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness. It was an admirable thing <b>and</b> altogether precious. When he took <b>it</b> out he had intended <b>to</b> fling <b>it</b> from him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> very hottest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed <b>the</b> Ring in his hand, hesitating, <b>and</b> forcing himself <b>to</b> remember all that Gandalf had told him; <b>and</b> then with an effort <b>of</b> will he made a movement, as if <b>to</b> cast <b>it</b> away—<b>but</b> he found that he had put <b>it</b> back in his pocket.
<br>   Gandalf laughed grimly. “You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let <b>it</b> go, nor will <b>to</b> damage <b>it</b>. And I could not “make” you—except <b>by</b> force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking <b>the</b> Ring, force is useless. Even if you took <b>it</b> <b>and</b> struck <b>it</b> with a heavy sledge-hammer, <b>it</b> would make <b>no</b> dint in <b>it</b>. It cannot be unmade <b>by</b> your hands, <b>or</b> <b>by</b> mine.
<br>   “Your small fire, <b>of</b> course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This Ring has already passed through <b>it</b> unscathed, <b>and</b> even unheated. But there is <b>no</b> smith’s forge in this Shire that could change <b>it</b> at all. Not even <b>the</b> anvils <b>and</b> furnaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt <b>and</b> consume <b>the</b> Rings <b>of</b> Power, <b>but</b> there is not now any dragon left <b>on</b> earth in which <b>the</b> old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon <b>the</b> Black, who could have harmed <b>the</b> One Ring, <b>the</b> Ruling Ring, for that was made <b>by</b> Sauron himself. There is only one way: <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Cracks <b>of</b> Doom in <b>the</b> depths <b>of</b> Orodruin, <b>the</b> Fire-mountain, <b>and</b> cast <b>the</b> Ring in there, if you really wish <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>, <b>to</b> put <b>it</b> beyond <b>the</b> grasp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy for ever.”
<br>   “I do really wish <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>!” cried Frodo. “Or, well, <b>to</b> have <b>it</b> destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen <b>the</b> Ring! Why did <b>it</b> come <b>to</b> me? Why was I chosen?”
<br>   “Such questions cannot be answered,” said Gandalf. “You may be sure that <b>it</b> was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power <b>or</b> wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, <b>and</b> you must therefore use such strength <b>and</b> heart <b>and</b> wits as you have.”
<br>   “But I have so little <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> these things! You are wise <b>and</b> powerful. Will you not take <b>the</b> Ring?”
<br>   “No!” cried Gandalf, springing <b>to</b> his feet. “With that power I should have power too great <b>and</b> terrible. And over me <b>the</b> Ring would gain a power still greater <b>and</b> more deadly.” His eyes flashed <b>and</b> his face was lit as <b>by</b> a fire within. “Do not tempt me! For I do not wish <b>to</b> become like <b>the</b> Dark Lord himself. Yet <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> my heart is <b>by</b> pity, pity for weakness <b>and</b> <b>the</b> desire <b>of</b> strength <b>to</b> do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not take <b>it</b>, not even <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b> safe, unused. The wish <b>to</b> wield <b>it</b> would be too great, for my strength. I shall have such need <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Great perils lie before me.”
<br>   He went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> drew aside <b>the</b> curtains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shutters. Sunlight streamed back again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room. Sam passed along <b>the</b> path outside whistling. “And now,” said <b>the</b> wizard, turning back <b>to</b> Frodo, “<b>the</b> decision lies with you. But I will always help you.” He laid his hand <b>on</b> Frodo’s shoulder. “I will help you bear this burden, as long as It is yours <b>to</b> bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.”
<br>   There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again <b>and</b> puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, <b>but</b> under <b>the</b> lids he was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at <b>the</b> red embers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth, until they filled all his vision, <b>and</b> he seemed <b>to</b> be looking down <b>into</b> profound wells <b>of</b> fire. He was thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabled Cracks <b>of</b> Doom <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fiery Mountain.
<br>   “Well!” said Gandalf at last. “What are you thinking about? Have you decided what <b>to</b> do?”
<br>   “No!” answered Frodo, coming back <b>to</b> himself out <b>of</b> darkness, <b>and</b> finding <b>to</b> his surprise that <b>it</b> was not dark, <b>and</b> that out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window he could see <b>the</b> sunlit garden. “Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what you have said, I suppose I must keep <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> guard <b>it</b>, at least for <b>the</b> present, whatever <b>it</b> may do <b>to</b> me.”
<br>   “Whatever <b>it</b> may do, <b>it</b> will be slow, slow <b>to</b> evil, if you keep <b>it</b> with that purpose,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “I hope so,” said Frodo. “But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon. But in <b>the</b> meanwhile <b>it</b> seems that I am a danger, a danger <b>to</b> all that live near me. I cannot keep <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> stay here. I ought <b>to</b> leave Bag End, leave <b>the</b> Shire, leave everything <b>and</b> go away.” He sighed.
<br>   “I should like <b>to</b> save <b>the</b> Shire, if I could—though there have been times when I thought <b>the</b> inhabitants too stupid <b>and</b> dull for words, <b>and</b> have felt that an earthquake <b>or</b> an invasion <b>of</b> dragons might be good for them. But I don’t feel like that now. I feel that as long as <b>the</b> Shire lies behind, safe <b>and</b> comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.
<br>   “Of course, I have sometimes thought <b>of</b> going away, <b>but</b> I imagined that as a kind <b>of</b> holiday, a series <b>of</b> adventures like Bilbo’s <b>or</b> better, ending in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger <b>into</b> danger, drawing <b>it</b> after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am <b>to</b> do that <b>and</b> save <b>the</b> Shire. But I feel very small, <b>and</b> very uprooted, <b>and</b> well—desperate. The Enemy is so strong <b>and</b> terrible.”
<br>   He did not tell Gandalf, <b>but</b> as he was speaking a great desire <b>to</b> follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart—<b>to</b> follow Bilbo, <b>and</b> even perhaps <b>to</b> find him again. It was so strong that <b>it</b> overcame his fear: he could almost have run out there <b>and</b> then down <b>the</b> road without his hat, as Bilbo had done <b>on</b> a similar morning long ago.
<br>   “My dear Frodo!” exclaimed Gandalf. “Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is <b>to</b> know about their ways in a month, <b>and</b> yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected <b>to</b> get such an answer, not even from you. But Bilbo made <b>no</b> mistake in choosing his heir, though he little thought how important <b>it</b> would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able <b>to</b> stay hidden in <b>the</b> Shire much longer; <b>and</b> for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have <b>to</b> go, <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe <b>to</b> have, outside <b>the</b> Shire <b>or</b> in <b>the</b> Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. Underhill.
<br>   “But I don’t think you need go alone. Not if you know <b>of</b> anyone you can trust, <b>and</b> who would be willing <b>to</b> go <b>by</b> your side—<b>and</b> that you would be willing <b>to</b> take <b>into</b> unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be careful in choosing! And be careful <b>of</b> what you say, even <b>to</b> your closest friends! The enemy has many spies <b>and</b> many ways <b>of</b> hearing.”
<br>   Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was very quiet, inside <b>and</b> outside. Gandalf crept <b>to</b> one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window. Then with a dart he sprang <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sill, <b>and</b> thrust a long arm out <b>and</b> downwards. There was a squawk, <b>and</b> up came Sam Gamgee’s curly head hauled <b>by</b> one ear.
<br>   “Well, well, bless my beard!” said Gandalf. “Sam Gamgee is <b>it</b>? Now what may you be doing?”
<br>   “Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!” said Sam. “Nothing! Leastways I was just trimming <b>the</b> grass-border under <b>the</b> window, if you follow me.” He picked up his shears <b>and</b> exhibited them as evidence.
<br>   “I don’t,” said Gandalf grimly. It is some time since I last heard <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?”
<br>   “Eavesdropping, sir? I don’t follow you, begging your pardon. There ain’t <b>no</b> eaves at Bag End, <b>and</b> that’s a fact.”
<br>   “Don’t be a fool! What have you heard, <b>and</b> why did you listen?” Gandalf’s eyes flashed <b>and</b> his brows stuck out like bristles.
<br>   “Mr. Frodo, sir!” cried Sam quaking. “Don’t let him hurt me, sir! Don’t let him turn me <b>into</b> anything unnatural! My old dad would take <b>on</b> so. I meant <b>no</b> harm, <b>on</b> my honour, sir!”
<br>   “He won’t hurt you,” said Frodo, hardly able <b>to</b> keep from laughing, although he was himself startled <b>and</b> rather puzzled. “He knows, as well as I do, that you mean <b>no</b> harm. But just you up <b>and</b> answer his questions straight away!”
<br>   “Well, sir,” said Sam dithering a little. “I heard a deal that I didn’t rightly understand, about an enemy, <b>and</b> rings, <b>and</b> Mr. Bilbo, sir, <b>and</b> dragons, <b>and</b> a fiery mountain, <b>and</b>—<b>and</b> Elves, sir. I listened because I couldn’t help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, <b>but</b> I do love tales <b>of</b> that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love <b>to</b> see them. Couldn’t you take me <b>to</b> see Elves, sir, when you go?”
<br>   Suddenly Gandalf laughed. “Come inside!” he shouted, <b>and</b> putting out both his arms he lifted <b>the</b> astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings <b>and</b> all, right through <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> stood him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. “Take you <b>to</b> see Elves, eh?” he said, eyeing Sam closely, <b>but</b> with a smile flickering <b>on</b> his face. “So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?”
<br>   “I did, sir. And that’s why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I tried not <b>to</b>, sir, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> burst out <b>of</b> me: I was so upset.”
<br>   “It can’t be helped, Sam,” said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized that flying from <b>the</b> Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> familiar comforts <b>of</b> Bag End. “I shall have <b>to</b> go. But”—<b>and</b> here he looked hard at Sam—“if you really care about me, you will keep that dead secret. See? If you don’t, if you even breathe a word <b>of</b> what you’ve heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you <b>into</b> a spotted toad <b>and</b> fill <b>the</b> garden full <b>of</b> grass-snakes.”
<br>   Sam fell <b>on</b> his knees, trembling. “Get up, Sam!” said Gandalf. I have thought <b>of</b> something better than that. Something <b>to</b> shut your mouth, <b>and</b> punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!”
<br>   “Me, sir!” cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. “Me go <b>and</b> see Elves <b>and</b> all! Hooray!” he shouted, <b>and</b> then burst <b>into</b> tears.
<br>   
<br>   
<br>Chapter 3
<br>THREE IS COMPANY
<br>
<br>   “You ought <b>to</b> go quietly, <b>and</b> you ought <b>to</b> go soon,” said Gandalf. Two <b>or</b> three weeks had passed, <b>and</b> still Frodo made <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> getting ready <b>to</b> go.
<br>   “I know. But <b>it</b> is difficult <b>to</b> do both,” he objected. If I just vanish like Bilbo, <b>the</b> tale will be all over <b>the</b> Shire in <b>no</b> time.”
<br>   “Of course you mustn’t vanish!” said Gandalf. “That wouldn’t do at all! I said soon, not instantly. If you can think <b>of</b> any way <b>of</b> slipping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire without its being generally known, <b>it</b> will be worth a little delay. But you must not delay too long.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> autumn, <b>on</b> <b>or</b> after Our Birthday?” asked Frodo. “I think I could probably make some arrangements <b>by</b> then.”
<br>   To tell <b>the</b> truth, he was very reluctant <b>to</b> start, now that <b>it</b> had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point. Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than <b>it</b> had for years, <b>and</b> he wanted <b>to</b> savour as much as he could <b>of</b> his last summer in <b>the</b> Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least <b>of</b> his heart would think more kindly <b>of</b> journeying, as <b>it</b> always did at that season. He had indeed privately made up his mind <b>to</b> leave <b>on</b> his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo’s one hundred <b>and</b> twenty-eighth. It seemed somehow <b>the</b> proper day <b>on</b> which <b>to</b> set out <b>and</b> follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> one thing that made <b>the</b> thought <b>of</b> leaving bearable. He thought as little as possible about <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> where <b>it</b> might lead him in <b>the</b> end. But he did not tell all his thoughts <b>to</b> Gandalf. What <b>the</b> wizard guessed was always difficult <b>to</b> tell.
<br>   He looked at Frodo <b>and</b> smiled. “Very well,” he said. “I think that will do—<b>but</b> <b>it</b> must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. In <b>the</b> mean-while, do take care, <b>and</b> don’t let out any hint <b>of</b> where you are going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him <b>into</b> a toad.”
<br>   “As for where I am going,” said Frodo, “<b>it</b> would be difficult <b>to</b> give that away, for I have <b>no</b> clear idea myself, yet.”
<br>   “Don’t be absurd!” said Gandalf. “I am not warning you against leaving an address at <b>the</b> post-office! But you are leaving <b>the</b> Shire—<b>and</b> that should not be known, until you are far away. And you must go, <b>or</b> at least set out, either North, South, West <b>or</b> East—<b>and</b> <b>the</b> direction should certainly not be known.”
<br>   “I have been so taken up with <b>the</b> thoughts <b>of</b> leaving Bag End, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> saying farewell, that I have never even considered <b>the</b> direction,” said Frodo. “For where am I <b>to</b> go? And <b>by</b> what shall I steer? What is <b>to</b> be my quest? Bilbo went <b>to</b> find a treasure, there <b>and</b> back again; <b>but</b> I go <b>to</b> lose one, <b>and</b> not return, as far as I can see.”
<br>   “But you cannot see very far,” said Gandalf. “Neither can I. It may be your task <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Cracks <b>of</b> Doom; <b>but</b> that quest may be for others: I do not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.”
<br>   “No indeed!” said Frodo. “But in <b>the</b> meantime what course am I <b>to</b> lake?”
<br>   “Towards danger; <b>but</b> not too rashly, nor too straight,” answered <b>the</b> wizard. “If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey should not prove too perilous, though <b>the</b> Road is less easy than <b>it</b> was, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will grow worse as <b>the</b> year fails.”
<br>   “Rivendell!” said Frodo. “Very good: I will go east, <b>and</b> I will make for Rivendell. I will take Sam <b>to</b> visit <b>the</b> Elves; he will be delighted.” He spoke lightly; <b>but</b> his heart was moved suddenly with a desire <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond Halfelven, <b>and</b> breathe <b>the</b> air <b>of</b> that deep valley where many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.
<br>   One summer’s evening an astonishing piece <b>of</b> news reached <b>the</b> Ivy Bush <b>and</b> Green Dragon. Giants <b>and</b> other portents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire were forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed he had already sold <b>it</b>—<b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses!
<br>   “For a nice bit, loo,” said some. “At a bargain price,” said others, “<b>and</b> that’s more likely when Mistress Lobelia’s <b>the</b> buyer.” (Otho had died some years before, at <b>the</b> ripe <b>but</b> disappointed age <b>of</b> 102.)
<br>   Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than <b>the</b> price. A few held <b>the</b> theory—supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nods <b>and</b> hints <b>of</b> Mr. Baggins himself—that Frodo’s money was running out: he was going <b>to</b> leave Hobbiton <b>and</b> live in a quiet way <b>on</b> <b>the</b> proceeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. “As far from <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses as may be,” some added. But so firmly fixed had <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immeasurable wealth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bagginses <b>of</b> Bag End become that most found this hard <b>to</b> believe, harder than any other reason <b>or</b> unreason that their fancy could suggest: <b>to</b> most <b>it</b> suggested a dark <b>and</b> yet unrevealed plot <b>by</b> Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet <b>and</b> did not go about <b>by</b> day, <b>it</b> was well known that he was “hiding up in <b>the</b> Bag End”. But however a removal might fit in with <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> his wizardry, there was <b>no</b> doubt about <b>the</b> fact: Frodo Baggins was going back <b>to</b> Buckland.
<br>   “Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,” he said. “Merry Brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me, <b>or</b> perhaps a small house.”
<br>   As a matter <b>of</b> fact with Merry’s help he had already chosen <b>and</b> bought a little house at Crickhollow in <b>the</b> country beyond Bucklebury. To all <b>but</b> Sam he pretended he was going <b>to</b> settle down there permanently. The decision <b>to</b> set out eastwards had suggested <b>the</b> idea <b>to</b> him; for Buckland was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least seem credible.
<br>   Gandalf stayed in <b>the</b> Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> June, soon after Frodo’s plan had been finally arranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. “Only for a short while, I hope,” he said. “But I am going down beyond <b>the</b> southern borders <b>to</b> get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.”
<br>   He spoke lightly, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that he looked rather worried. “Has anything happened?” he asked.
<br>   “Well <b>no</b>; <b>but</b> I have heard something that has made me anxious <b>and</b> needs looking <b>into</b>. If I think <b>it</b> necessary after all for you <b>to</b> get off at once, I shall come back immediately, <b>or</b> at least send word. In <b>the</b> meanwhile stick <b>to</b> your plan; <b>but</b> be more careful than ever, especially <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring. Let me impress <b>on</b> you once more: don’t use <b>it</b>!”
<br>   He went off at dawn. “I may be back any day,” he said. “At <b>the</b> very latest I shall come back for <b>the</b> farewell party. I think after all you may need my company <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, <b>and</b> wondered often what Gandalf could have heard; <b>but</b> his uneasiness wore off, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire had seldom seen so fair a summer, <b>or</b> so rich an autumn: <b>the</b> trees were laden with apples, honey was dripping in <b>the</b> combs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> corn was tall <b>and</b> full.
<br>   Autumn was well under way before Frodo began <b>to</b> worry about Gandalf again. September was passing <b>and</b> there was still <b>no</b> news <b>of</b> him. The Birthday, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> removal, drew nearer, <b>and</b> still he did not come, <b>or</b> send word. Bag End began <b>to</b> be busy. Some <b>of</b> Frodo’s friends came <b>to</b> stay <b>and</b> help him with <b>the</b> packing: there was Fredegar Bolger <b>and</b> Folco Boffin, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> course his special friends Pippin Took <b>and</b> Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned <b>the</b> whole place upside-down.
<br>   On September 20th two covered carts went off laden <b>to</b> Buckland, conveying <b>the</b> furniture <b>and</b> goods that Frodo had not sold <b>to</b> his new home, <b>by</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became really anxious, <b>and</b> kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning, dawned as fair <b>and</b> clear as <b>it</b> had long ago for Bilbo’s great party. Still Gandalf did not appear. In <b>the</b> evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: <b>it</b> was quite small, just a dinner for himself <b>and</b> his four helpers; <b>but</b> he was troubled <b>and</b> fell in <b>no</b> mood for <b>it</b>. The thought that he would so soon have <b>to</b> part with his young friends weighed <b>on</b> his heart. He wondered how he would break <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them.
<br>   The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> party soon became very cheerful in spite <b>of</b> Gandalf’s absence. The dining-room was bare except for a table <b>and</b> chairs, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> food was good, <b>and</b> there was good wine: Frodo’s wine had not been included in <b>the</b> sale <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses.
<br>   “Whatever happens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> my stuff, when <b>the</b> S.-B.s get their claws <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, at any rate I have found a good home for this!” said Frodo, as he drained his glass. It was <b>the</b> last drop <b>of</b> Old Winyards.
<br>   When they had sung many songs, <b>and</b> talked <b>of</b> many things they had done together, they toasted Bilbo’s birthday, <b>and</b> they drank his health <b>and</b> Frodo’s together according <b>to</b> Frodo’s custom. Then they went out for a sniff <b>of</b> air, <b>and</b> glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars, <b>and</b> then they went <b>to</b> bed. Frodo’s party was over, <b>and</b> Gandalf had not come.
<br>   The next morning they were busy packing another cart with <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> luggage. Merry took charge <b>of</b> this, <b>and</b> drove off with Fatty (that is Fredegar Bolger). “Someone must get there <b>and</b> warm <b>the</b> house before you arrive,” said Merry. “Well, see you later—<b>the</b> day after tomorrow, if you don’t go <b>to</b> sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way!”
<br>   Folco went home after lunch, <b>but</b> Pippin remained behind. Frodo was restless <b>and</b> anxious, listening in vain for a sound <b>of</b> Gandalf. He decided <b>to</b> wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go <b>to</b> Crickhollow, <b>and</b> might even get there first. For Frodo was going <b>on</b> foot. His plan—for pleasure <b>and</b> a last look at <b>the</b> Shire as much as any other reason—was <b>to</b> walk from Hobbiton <b>to</b> Bucklebury Ferry, taking <b>it</b> fairly easy.
<br>   “I shall get myself a bit <b>into</b> training, too,” he said, looking at himself in a dusty mirror in <b>the</b> half-empty hall. He had not done any strenuous walking for a long time, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reflection looked rather flabby, he thought.
<br>   After lunch, <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia <b>and</b> her sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much <b>to</b> Frodo’s annoyance. “Ours at last!” said Lobelia, as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be forgiven: she had been obliged <b>to</b> wait about seventy-seven years longer for Bag End than she once hoped, <b>and</b> she was now a hundred years old. Anyway, she had come <b>to</b> see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; <b>and</b> she wanted <b>the</b> keys. It took a long while <b>to</b> satisfy her, as she had brought a complete inventory with her <b>and</b> went right through <b>it</b>. In <b>the</b> end she departed with Lotho <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spare key <b>and</b> <b>the</b> promise that <b>the</b> other key would be left at <b>the</b> Gamgees” in Bagshot Row. She snorted, <b>and</b> showed plainly that she thought <b>the</b> Gamgees capable <b>of</b> plundering <b>the</b> hole during <b>the</b> night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.
<br>   He took his own tea with Pippin <b>and</b> Sam Gamgee in <b>the</b> kitchen. It had been officially announced that Sam was coming <b>to</b> Buckland “<b>to</b> do for Mr. Frodo <b>and</b> look after his bit <b>of</b> garden”; an arrangement that was approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Gaffer, though <b>it</b> did not console him for <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> having Lobelia as a neighbour.
<br>   “Our last meal at Bag End!” said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They left <b>the</b> washing up for Lobelia. Pippin <b>and</b> Sam strapped up their three packs <b>and</b> piled them in <b>the</b> porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll in <b>the</b> garden. Sam disappeared.
<br>   The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad <b>and</b> gloomy <b>and</b> dishevelled. Frodo wandered round <b>the</b> familiar rooms, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunset fade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls, <b>and</b> shadows creep out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out <b>and</b> walked down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> a short way down <b>the</b> Hill Road. He half expected <b>to</b> see Gandalf come striding up through <b>the</b> dusk.
<br>   The sky was clear <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stars were growing bright. “It’s going <b>to</b> be a fine night,” he said aloud. “That’s good for a beginning. I feel like walking. I can’t bear any more hanging about. I am going <b>to</b> start, <b>and</b> Gandalf must follow me.” He turned <b>to</b> go back, <b>and</b> then slopped, for he heard voices, just round <b>the</b> corner <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Bagshot Row. One voice was certainly <b>the</b> old Gaffer’s; <b>the</b> other was strange, <b>and</b> somehow unpleasant. He could not make out what <b>it</b> said, <b>but</b> he heard <b>the</b> Gaffer’s answers, which were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out.
<br>   “No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, <b>and</b> my Sam went with him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out <b>and</b> gone, I tell’ee. Why? Why’s none <b>of</b> my business, <b>or</b> yours. Where <b>to</b>? That ain’t <b>no</b> secret. He’s moved <b>to</b> Bucklebury <b>or</b> some such place, away down yonder. Yes <b>it</b> is—a tidy way. I’ve never been so far myself; they’re queer folks in Buckland. No, I can’t give <b>no</b> message. Good night <b>to</b> you!”
<br>   Footsteps went away down <b>the</b> Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why <b>the</b> fact that they did not come <b>on</b> up <b>the</b> Hill seemed a great relief. “I am sick <b>of</b> questions <b>and</b> curiosity about my doings, I suppose,” he thought. “What an inquisitive lot they all are!” He had half a mind <b>to</b> go <b>and</b> ask <b>the</b> Gaffer who <b>the</b> inquirer was; <b>but</b> he thought better (<b>or</b> worse) <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> turned <b>and</b> walked quickly back <b>to</b> Bag End.
<br>   Pippin was sitting <b>on</b> his pack in <b>the</b> porch. Sam was not there. Frodo stepped inside <b>the</b> dark door. “Sam!” he called. “Sam! Time!”
<br>   “Coming, sir!” came <b>the</b> answer from far within, followed soon <b>by</b> Sam himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beer-barrel in <b>the</b> cellar.
<br>   “All aboard, Sam?” said Frodo.
<br>   “Yes, sir. I’ll last for a bit now, sir.”
<br>   Frodo shut <b>and</b> locked <b>the</b> round door, <b>and</b> gave <b>the</b> key <b>to</b> Sam. “Run down with this <b>to</b> your home, Sam!” he said. “Then cut along <b>the</b> Row <b>and</b> meet us as quick as you can at <b>the</b> gate in <b>the</b> lane beyond <b>the</b> meadows. We are not going through <b>the</b> village tonight. Too many ears pricking <b>and</b> eyes prying.” Sam ran off at full speed.
<br>   “Well, now we’re off at last!” said Frodo. They shouldered their packs <b>and</b> took up their sticks, <b>and</b> walked round <b>the</b> corner <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> Bag End. “Good-bye!” said Frodo, looking at <b>the</b> dark blank windows. He waved his hand, <b>and</b> then turned <b>and</b> (following Bilbo, if he had known <b>it</b>) hurried after Peregrin down <b>the</b> garden-path. They jumped over <b>the</b> low place in <b>the</b> hedge at <b>the</b> bottom <b>and</b> took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fields, passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness like a rustle in <b>the</b> grasses.
<br>   At <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hill <b>on</b> its western side they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate opening <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a narrow lane. There they halted <b>and</b> adjusted <b>the</b> straps <b>of</b> their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly <b>and</b> breathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high <b>on</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> he had put <b>on</b> his head a tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. In <b>the</b> gloom he looked very much like a dwarf.
<br>   “I am sure you have given me all <b>the</b> heaviest stuff,” said Frodo. “I pity snails, <b>and</b> all that carry their homes <b>on</b> their backs.”
<br>   “I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,” said Sam stoutly <b>and</b> untruthfully.
<br>   “No, you don’t, Sam!” said Pippin. “It is good for him. He’s got nothing except what he ordered us <b>to</b> pack. He’s been slack lately, <b>and</b> he’ll feel <b>the</b> weight less when he’s walked off some <b>of</b> his own.”
<br>   “Be kind <b>to</b> a poor old hobbit!” laughed Frodo. “I shall be as thin as a willow-wand, I’m sure, before I get <b>to</b> Buckland. But I was talking nonsense. I suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, <b>and</b> I shall look <b>into</b> <b>it</b> at our next packing.” He picked up his stick again. “Well, we all like walking in <b>the</b> dark,” he said, “so let’s put some miles behind us before bed.”
<br>   For a short way they followed <b>the</b> lane westwards. Then leaving <b>it</b> they turned left <b>and</b> took quietly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fields again. They went in single file along hedgerows <b>and</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> coppices, <b>and</b> night fell dark about them. In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. Since they were all hobbits, <b>and</b> were trying <b>to</b> be silent, they made <b>no</b> noise that even hobbits would hear. Even <b>the</b> wild things in <b>the</b> fields <b>and</b> woods hardly noticed their passing.
<br>   After some time they crossed <b>the</b> Water, west <b>of</b> Hobbiton, <b>by</b> a narrow plank-bridge. The stream was there <b>no</b> more than a winding black ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile <b>or</b> two further south they hastily crossed <b>the</b> great road from <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge; they were now in <b>the</b> Tookland <b>and</b> bending south-eastwards they made for <b>the</b> Green Hill Country. As they began <b>to</b> climb its first slopes they looked back <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in <b>the</b> gentle valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Water. Soon <b>it</b> disappeared in <b>the</b> folds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkened land, <b>and</b> was followed <b>by</b> Bywater beside its grey pool. When <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last farm was far behind, peeping among <b>the</b> trees, Frodo turned <b>and</b> waved a hand in farewell.
<br>   “I wonder if I shall ever look down <b>into</b> that valley again,” he said quietly.
<br>   When they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was clear, cool, <b>and</b> starry, <b>but</b> smoke-like wisps <b>of</b> mist were creeping up <b>the</b> hill-sides from <b>the</b> streams <b>and</b> deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads, made a black net against <b>the</b> pale sky. They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), <b>and</b> then went <b>on</b> again. Soon they struck a narrow road, that went rolling up <b>and</b> down, fading grey <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness ahead: <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> Woodhall, <b>and</b> Stock, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away from <b>the</b> main road in <b>the</b> Water-valley, <b>and</b> wound over <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Green Hills towards Woody-End, a wild corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing.
<br>   After a while they plunged <b>into</b> a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in <b>the</b> night. It was very dark. At first they talked, <b>or</b> hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from inquisitive ears. Then they marched <b>on</b> in silence, <b>and</b> Pippin began <b>to</b> lag behind. At last, as they began <b>to</b> climb a steep slope, he stopped <b>and</b> yawned.
<br>   “I am so sleepy,” he said, “that soon I shall fall down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. Are you going <b>to</b> sleep <b>on</b> your legs? It is nearly midnight.”
<br>   “I thought you liked walking in <b>the</b> dark,” said Frodo. “But there is <b>no</b> great hurry. Merry expects us some time <b>the</b> day after tomorrow; <b>but</b> that leaves us nearly two days more. We’ll halt at <b>the</b> first likely spot.”
<br>   “The wind’s in <b>the</b> West,” said Sam. “If we get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered <b>and</b> snug enough, sir. There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.” Sam knew <b>the</b> land well within twenty miles <b>of</b> Hobbiton, <b>but</b> that was <b>the</b> limit <b>of</b> his geography.
<br>   Just over <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill they came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> patch <b>of</b> fir-wood. Leaving <b>the</b> road they went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep resin-scented darkness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> gathered dead sticks <b>and</b> cones <b>to</b> make a fire. Soon they had a merry crackle <b>of</b> flame at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> a large fir-tree <b>and</b> they sat round <b>it</b> for a while, until they began <b>to</b> nod. Then, each in an angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great tree’s roots, they curled up in their cloaks <b>and</b> blankets, <b>and</b> were soon fast asleep. They set <b>no</b> watch; even Frodo feared <b>no</b> danger yet, for they were still in <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. A few creatures came <b>and</b> looked at them when <b>the</b> fire had died away. A fox passing through <b>the</b> wood <b>on</b> business <b>of</b> his own stopped several minutes <b>and</b> sniffed.
<br>   “Hobbits!” he thought. “Well, what next? I have heard <b>of</b> strange doings in this land, <b>but</b> I have seldom heard <b>of</b> a hobbit sleeping out <b>of</b> doors under a tree. Three <b>of</b> them! There’s something mighty queer behind this.” He was quite right, <b>but</b> he never found out any more about <b>it</b>.
<br>   The morning came, pale <b>and</b> clammy. Frodo woke up first, <b>and</b> found that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, <b>and</b> that his neck was stiff.
<br>   “Walking for pleasure! Why didn’t I drive?” he thought, as he usually did at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> an expedition. “And all my beautiful feather beds are sold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good.” He stretched. “Wake up, hobbits!” he cried. It’s a beautiful morning.”
<br>   “What’s beautiful about <b>it</b>?” said Pippin, peering over <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> his blanket with one eye. “Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you got <b>the</b> bath-water hot?”
<br>   Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. “No, sir, I haven’t, sir!” he said.
<br>   Frodo stripped <b>the</b> blankets from Pippin <b>and</b> rolled him over, <b>and</b> then walked off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. Away eastward <b>the</b> sun was rising red out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mists that lay thick <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world. Touched with gold <b>and</b> red <b>the</b> autumn trees seemed <b>to</b> be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>the</b> road ran down steeply <b>into</b> a hollow <b>and</b> disappeared.
<br>   When he returned Sam <b>and</b> Pippin had got a good fire going. “Water!” shouted Pippin. “Where’s <b>the</b> water?”
<br>   “I don’t keep water in my pockets,” said Frodo. “We thought you had gone <b>to</b> find some,” said Pippin, busy setting out <b>the</b> food, <b>and</b> cups. “You had better go now.”
<br>   “You can come too,” said Frodo, “<b>and</b> bring all <b>the</b> water-bottles.” There was a stream at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. They filled their bottles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> small camping kettle at a little fall where <b>the</b> water fell a few feet over an outcrop <b>of</b> grey stone. It was icy cold; <b>and</b> they spluttered <b>and</b> puffed as they bathed their faces <b>and</b> hands.
<br>   When their breakfast was over, <b>and</b> their packs all trussed up again, <b>it</b> was after ten o’clock, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> day was beginning <b>to</b> turn fine <b>and</b> hot. They went down <b>the</b> slope, <b>and</b> across <b>the</b> stream where <b>it</b> dived under <b>the</b> road, <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> next slope, <b>and</b> up <b>and</b> down another shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills; <b>and</b> <b>by</b> that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, <b>and</b> other gear already seemed a heavy burden.
<br>   The day’s march promised <b>to</b> be warm <b>and</b> tiring work. After some miles, however, <b>the</b> road ceased <b>to</b> roll up <b>and</b> down: <b>it</b> climbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort <b>of</b> way, <b>and</b> then prepared <b>to</b> go down for <b>the</b> last time. In front <b>of</b> them they saw <b>the</b> lower lands dotted with small clumps <b>of</b> trees that melted away in <b>the</b> distance <b>to</b> a brown woodland haze. They were looking across <b>the</b> Woody End towards <b>the</b> Brandywine River. The road wound away before them like a piece <b>of</b> string.
<br>   “The road goes <b>on</b> for ever,” said Pippin; “<b>but</b> I can’t without a rest. It is high time for lunch.” He sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank at <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> looked away east <b>into</b> <b>the</b> haze, beyond which lay <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood <b>by</b> him. His round eyes were wide open—for he was looking across lands he had never seen <b>to</b> a new horizon.
<br>   “Do Elves live in those woods?” he asked.
<br>   “Not that I ever heard,” said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was gazing eastward along <b>the</b> road, as if he had never seen <b>it</b> before. Suddenly he spoke, aloud <b>but</b> as if <b>to</b> himself, saying slowly:
<br>   
<br>The Road goes ever <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b>
<br>Down from <b>the</b> door where <b>it</b> began.
<br>Now far ahead <b>the</b> Road has gone,
<br>And I must follow, if I can,
<br>Pursuing <b>it</b> with weary feet,
<br>Until <b>it</b> joins some larger way,
<br>Where many paths <b>and</b> errands meet.
<br>And whither then? I cannot say.
<br>   
<br>   “That sounds like a bit <b>of</b> old Bilbo’s rhyming,” said Pippin. “Or is <b>it</b> one <b>of</b> your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.”
<br>   “I don’t know,” said Frodo. It came <b>to</b> me then, as if I was making <b>it</b> up; <b>but</b> I may have heard <b>it</b> long ago. Certainly <b>it</b> reminds me very much <b>of</b> Bilbo in <b>the</b> last years, before he went away. He used often <b>to</b> say there was only one Road; that <b>it</b> was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, <b>and</b> every path was its tributary. “It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out <b>of</b> your door,” he used <b>to</b> say. “You step <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> if you don’t keep your feet, there is <b>no</b> knowing where you might be swept off <b>to</b>. Do you realize that this is <b>the</b> very path that goes through Mirkwood, <b>and</b> that if you let <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> might take you <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain <b>or</b> even further <b>and</b> <b>to</b> worse places?” He used <b>to</b> say that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path outside <b>the</b> front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a long walk.”
<br>   “Well, <b>the</b> Road won’t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,” said Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example, putting their packs against <b>the</b> bank <b>and</b> their legs out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> road. After a rest they had a good lunch, <b>and</b> then more rest.
<br>   The sun was beginning <b>to</b> get low <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> afternoon was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land as they went down <b>the</b> hill. So far they had not met a soul <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, <b>and</b> there was little traffic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour <b>or</b> more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now <b>on</b> level ground, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approaching woods.
<br>   “I can hear a pony <b>or</b> a horse coming along <b>the</b> road behind,” said Sam.
<br>   They looked back, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road prevented them from seeing far. “I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,” said Frodo; <b>but</b> even as he said <b>it</b>, he had a feeling that <b>it</b> was not so, <b>and</b> a sudden desire <b>to</b> hide from <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider came over him.
<br>   “It may not matter much,” he said apologetically, “<b>but</b> I would rather not be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road—<b>by</b> anyone. I am sick <b>of</b> my doings being noticed <b>and</b> discussed. And if <b>it</b> is Gandalf,” he added as an afterthought, “we can give him a little surprise, <b>to</b> pay him out for being so late. Let’s get out <b>of</b> sight!”
<br>   The other two ran quickly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> a little hollow not far from <b>the</b> road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity <b>or</b> some other feeling was struggling with his desire <b>to</b> hide. The sound <b>of</b> hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch <b>of</b> long grass behind a tree that overshadowed <b>the</b> road. Then he lifted his head <b>and</b> peered cautiously above one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great roots.
<br>   Round <b>the</b> corner came a black horse, <b>no</b> hobbit-pony <b>but</b> a full-sized horse; <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> sat a large man, who seemed <b>to</b> crouch in <b>the</b> saddle, wrapped in a great black cloak <b>and</b> hood, so that only his boots in <b>the</b> high stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed <b>and</b> invisible.
<br>   When <b>it</b> reached <b>the</b> tree <b>and</b> was level with Frodo <b>the</b> horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From inside <b>the</b> hood came a noise as <b>of</b> someone sniffing <b>to</b> catch an elusive scent; <b>the</b> head turned from side <b>to</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road.
<br>   A sudden unreasoning fear <b>of</b> discovery laid hold <b>of</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> he thought <b>of</b> his Ring. He hardly dared <b>to</b> breathe, <b>and</b> yet <b>the</b> desire <b>to</b> get <b>it</b> out <b>of</b> his pocket became so strong that he began slowly <b>to</b> move his hand. He felt that he had only <b>to</b> slip <b>it</b> <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> then he would be safe. The advice <b>of</b> Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used <b>the</b> Ring. “And I am still in <b>the</b> Shire,” he thought, as his hand touched <b>the</b> chain <b>on</b> which <b>it</b> hung. At that moment <b>the</b> rider sat up, <b>and</b> shook <b>the</b> reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first, <b>and</b> then breaking <b>into</b> a quick trot.
<br>   Frodo crawled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> watched <b>the</b> rider, until he dwindled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance. He could not be quite sure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that suddenly, before <b>it</b> passed out <b>of</b> sight, <b>the</b> horse turned aside <b>and</b> went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right.
<br>   “Well, I call that very queer, <b>and</b> indeed disturbing,” said Frodo <b>to</b> himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin <b>and</b> Sam had remained flat in <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> had seen nothing; so Frodo described <b>the</b> rider <b>and</b> his strange behaviour.
<br>   “I can’t say why, <b>but</b> I felt certain he was looking <b>or</b> smelling for me; <b>and</b> also I felt certain that I did not want him <b>to</b> discover me. I’ve never seen <b>or</b> fell anything like <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> Shire before.”
<br>   “But what has one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People got <b>to</b> do with us?” said Pippin. “And what is he doing in this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world?”
<br>   “There are some Men about,” said Frodo. “Down in <b>the</b> Southfarthing they have had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I have never heard <b>of</b> anything like this rider. I wonder where he comes from.”
<br>   “Begging your pardon,” put in Sam suddenly, “I know where he comes from. It’s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there’s more than one. And I know where he’s going <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “What do you mean?” said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. “Why didn’t you speak up before?”
<br>   “I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back <b>to</b> our hole yesterday evening with <b>the</b> key, my dad, he says <b>to</b> me: Hello, Sam! he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There’s been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins <b>of</b> Bag End, <b>and</b> he’s only just gone. I’ve sent him <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Bucklebury. Not that I liked <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> him. He seemed mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had left his old home for good. Hissed at me, he did. It gave me quite a shudder. What sort <b>of</b> a fellow was he? says I <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gaffer. I don’t know, says he; <b>but</b> he wasn’t a hobbit. He was tall <b>and</b> black-like, <b>and</b> he stooped aver me. I reckon <b>it</b> was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny.
<br>   “I couldn’t stay <b>to</b> hear more, sir, since you were waiting; <b>and</b> I didn’t give much heed <b>to</b> <b>it</b> myself. The Gaffer is getting old, <b>and</b> more than a bit blind, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> must have been near dark when this fellow come up <b>the</b> Hill <b>and</b> found him taking <b>the</b> air at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> our Row. I hope he hasn’t done <b>no</b> harm, sir, nor me.”
<br>   “The Gaffer can’t be blamed anyway,” said Frodo. “As a matter <b>of</b> fact I heard him talking <b>to</b> a stranger, who seemed <b>to</b> be inquiring for me, <b>and</b> I nearly went <b>and</b> asked him who <b>it</b> was. I wish I had, <b>or</b> you had told me about <b>it</b> before. I might have been more careful <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road.”
<br>   “Still, there may be <b>no</b> connexion between this rider <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gaffer’s stranger,” said Pippin. “We left Hobbiton secretly enough, <b>and</b> I don’t see how he could have followed us.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> smelling, sir?” said Sam. “And <b>the</b> Gaffer said he was a black chap.”
<br>   “I wish I had waited for Gandalf,” Frodo muttered. “But perhaps <b>it</b> would only have made matters worse.”
<br>   “Then you know <b>or</b> guess something about this rider?” said Pippin, who had caught <b>the</b> muttered words.
<br>   “I don’t know, <b>and</b> I would rather not guess,” said Frodo. “All right, cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for <b>the</b> present, if you want <b>to</b> be mysterious. In <b>the</b> meanwhile what are we <b>to</b> do? I should like a bite <b>and</b> a sup, <b>but</b> somehow I think we had better move <b>on</b> from here. Your talk <b>of</b> sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.”
<br>   “Yes, I think we will move <b>on</b> now,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road -in case that rider comes back, <b>or</b> another follows him. We ought <b>to</b> do a good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.”
<br>   The shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees were long <b>and</b> thin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, as they started off again. They now kept a stone’s throw <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, <b>and</b> kept out <b>of</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as much as they could. But this hindered them; for <b>the</b> grass was thick <b>and</b> tussocky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground uneven, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees began <b>to</b> draw together <b>into</b> thickets.
<br>   The sun had gone down red behind <b>the</b> hills at their backs, <b>and</b> evening was coming <b>on</b> before they came back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long level over which <b>it</b> had run straight for some miles. At that point <b>it</b> bent left <b>and</b> went down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lowlands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yale making for Stock; <b>but</b> a lane branched right, winding through a wood <b>of</b> ancient oak-trees <b>on</b> its way <b>to</b> Woodhall. “That is <b>the</b> way for us,” said Frodo.
<br>   Not far from <b>the</b> road-meeting they came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> huge hulk <b>of</b> a tree: <b>it</b> was still alive <b>and</b> had leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small branches that <b>it</b> had put out round <b>the</b> broken stumps <b>of</b> its long-fallen limbs; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was hollow, <b>and</b> could be entered <b>by</b> a great crack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side away from <b>the</b> road. The hobbits crept inside, <b>and</b> sat there upon a floor <b>of</b> old leaves <b>and</b> decayed wood. They rested <b>and</b> had a light meal, talking quietly <b>and</b> listening from time <b>to</b> time.
<br>   Twilight was about them as they crept back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lane. The West wind was sighing in <b>the</b> branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon <b>the</b> road began <b>to</b> fall gently <b>but</b> steadily <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusk. A star came out above <b>the</b> trees in <b>the</b> darkening East before them. They went abreast <b>and</b> in step, <b>to</b> keep up their spirits. After a time, as <b>the</b> stars grew thicker <b>and</b> brighter, <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> disquiet left them, <b>and</b> they <b>no</b> longer listened for <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> hoofs. They began <b>to</b> hum softly, as hobbits have a way <b>of</b> doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near <b>to</b> home at night. With most hobbits <b>it</b> is a supper-song <b>or</b> a bed-song; <b>but</b> these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, <b>of</b> course, without any mention <b>of</b> supper <b>and</b> bed). Bilbo Baggins had made <b>the</b> words, <b>to</b> a tune that was as old as <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> taught <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Frodo as they walked in <b>the</b> lanes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Water-valley <b>and</b> talked about Adventure.
<br>   
<br>Upon <b>the</b> hearth <b>the</b> fire is red,
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> roof there is a bed;
<br>But not yet weary are our feet,
<br>Still round <b>the</b> corner we may meet
<br>A sudden tree <b>or</b> standing stone
<br>That none have seen <b>but</b> we alone.
<br>Tree <b>and</b> flower <b>and</b> leaf <b>and</b> grass,
<br>Let them pass! Let them pass!
<br>Hill <b>and</b> water under sky,
<br>Pass them <b>by</b>! Pass them <b>by</b>!
<br>
<br>Still round <b>the</b> corner there may wait
<br>A new road <b>or</b> a secret gate,
<br>And though we pass them <b>by</b> today,
<br>Tomorrow we may come this way
<br>And take <b>the</b> hidden paths that run
<br>Towards <b>the</b> Moon <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun.
<br>Apple, thorn, <b>and</b> nut <b>and</b> sloe,
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>Sand <b>and</b> stone <b>and</b> pool <b>and</b> dell,
<br>Fare you well! Fare you well!
<br>
<br>Home is behind, <b>the</b> world ahead,
<br>And there are many paths <b>to</b> tread
<br>Through shadows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> night,
<br>Until <b>the</b> stars are all alight.
<br>Then world behind <b>and</b> home ahead,
<br>We’ll wander back <b>to</b> home <b>and</b> bed.
<br>Mist <b>and</b> twilight, cloud <b>and</b> shade,
<br>Away shall fade! Away shall fade!
<br>Fire <b>and</b> lamp, <b>and</b> meat <b>and</b> bread,
<br>And then <b>to</b> bed! And then <b>to</b> bed!
<br>   
<br>   The song ended. “And now <b>to</b> bed! And now <b>to</b> bed!” sang Pippin in a high voice.
<br>   “Hush!” said Frodo. “I think I hear hoofs again.”
<br>   They slopped suddenly <b>and</b> stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. There was a sound <b>of</b> hoofs in <b>the</b> lane, some way behind, <b>but</b> coming slow <b>and</b> clear down <b>the</b> wind. Quickly <b>and</b> quietly they slipped off <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deeper shade under <b>the</b> oak-trees.
<br>   “Don’t let us go too far!” said Frodo. “I don’t want <b>to</b> be seen, <b>but</b> I want <b>to</b> see if <b>it</b> is another Black Rider.”
<br>   “Very well!” said Pippin. “But don’t forget <b>the</b> sniffing!”
<br>   The hoofs drew nearer. They had <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> find any hiding-place better than <b>the</b> general darkness under <b>the</b> trees; Sam <b>and</b> Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards <b>the</b> lane. It showed grey <b>and</b> pale, a line <b>of</b> fading light through <b>the</b> wood. Above <b>it</b> <b>the</b> stars were thick in <b>the</b> dim sky, <b>but</b> there was <b>no</b> moon.
<br>   The sound <b>of</b> hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass across <b>the</b> lighter space between two trees, <b>and</b> then halt. It looked like <b>the</b> black shade <b>of</b> a horse led <b>by</b> a smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where they had left <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> swayed from side <b>to</b> side. Frodo thought he heard <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> snuffling. The shadow bent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> then began <b>to</b> crawl towards him.
<br>   Once more <b>the</b> desire <b>to</b> slip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring came over Frodo; <b>but</b> this time <b>it</b> was stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he realized what he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket. But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song <b>and</b> laughter. Clear voices rose <b>and</b> fell in <b>the</b> starlit air. The black shadow straightened up <b>and</b> retreated. It climbed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shadowy horse <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> vanish across <b>the</b> lane <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. Frodo breathed again.
<br>   “Elves!” exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. “Elves, sir!” He would have burst out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> dashed off towards <b>the</b> voices, if they had not pulled him back.
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> is Elves,” said Frodo. “One can meet them sometimes in <b>the</b> Woody End. They don’t live in <b>the</b> Shire, <b>but</b> they wander <b>into</b> <b>it</b> in Spring <b>and</b> Autumn, out <b>of</b> their own lands away beyond <b>the</b> Tower Hills. I am thankful that they do! You did not see, <b>but</b> that Black Rider stopped just here <b>and</b> was actually crawling towards us when <b>the</b> song began. As soon as he heard <b>the</b> voices he slipped away.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> Elves?” said Sam, too excited <b>to</b> trouble about <b>the</b> rider. “Can’t we go <b>and</b> see them?”
<br>   “Listen! They are coming this way,” said Frodo. “We have only <b>to</b> wait.” The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above <b>the</b> others. It was singing in <b>the</b> fair elven-tongue, <b>of</b> which Frodo knew only a little, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others knew nothing. Yet <b>the</b> sound blending with <b>the</b> melody seemed <b>to</b> shape itself in their thought <b>into</b> words which they only partly understood. This was <b>the</b> song as Frodo heard <b>it</b>:
<br>   
<br>Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!
<br>O Queen beyond <b>the</b> Western Seas!
<br>O Light <b>to</b> us that wander here
<br>Amid <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> woven trees!
<br>
<br>Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!
<br>Clear are thy eyes <b>and</b> bright thy breath!
<br>Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing <b>to</b> thee
<br>In a far land beyond <b>the</b> Sea.
<br>
<br>O stars that in <b>the</b> Sunless Year
<br>With shining hand <b>by</b> her were sawn,
<br>In windy fields now bright <b>and</b> clear
<br>We see your silver blossom blown!
<br>
<br>O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!
<br>We still remember, we who dwell
<br>In this far land beneath <b>the</b> trees,
<br>Thy starlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Seas.
<br>   
<br>   The song ended. “These are High Elves! They spoke <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Elbereth!” said Frodo in amazement, “Few <b>of</b> that fairest folk are ever seen in <b>the</b> Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Sea. This is indeed a strange chance!”
<br>   The hobbits sat in shadow <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wayside. Before long <b>the</b> Elves came down <b>the</b> lane towards <b>the</b> valley. They passed slowly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits could see <b>the</b> starlight glimmering <b>on</b> their hair <b>and</b> in their eyes. They bore <b>no</b> lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon above <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills before <b>it</b> rises, seemed <b>to</b> fall about their feet. They were now silent, <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> last Elf passed he turned <b>and</b> looked towards <b>the</b> hobbits <b>and</b> laughed.
<br>   “Hail, Frodo!” he cried. “You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps lost?” Then he called aloud <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> company stopped <b>and</b> gathered round.
<br>   “This is indeed wonderful!” they said. “Three hobbits in a wood at night! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What is <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “The meaning <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, fair people,” said Frodo, “is simply that we seem <b>to</b> be going <b>the</b> same way as you are. I like walking under <b>the</b> stars. But I would welcome your company.”
<br>   “But we have <b>no</b> need <b>of</b> other company, <b>and</b> hobbits are so dull,” they laughed. “And how do you know that we go <b>the</b> same way as you, for you do not know whither we are going?”
<br>   “And how do you know my name?” asked Frodo in return.
<br>   “We know many things,” they said. “We have seen you often before with Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.”
<br>   “Who are you, <b>and</b> who is your lord?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “I am Gildor,” answered their leader, <b>the</b> Elf who had first hailed him. “Gildor Inglorion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Finrod. We are Exiles, <b>and</b> most <b>of</b> our kindred have long ago departed <b>and</b> we too are now only tarrying here a while, ere we return over <b>the</b> Great Sea. But some <b>of</b> our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us what you are doing? For we see that there is some shadow <b>of</b> fear upon you.”
<br>   “O Wise People!” interrupted Pippin eagerly. “Tell us about <b>the</b> Black Riders!”
<br>   “Black Riders?” they said in low voices. “Why do you ask about Black Riders?”
<br>   “Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, <b>or</b> one has done so twice,” said Pippin; “only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near.”
<br>   The Elves did not answer at once, <b>but</b> spoke together softly in their own tongue. At length Gildor turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “We will not speak <b>of</b> this here,” he said. “We think you had best come now with us. It is not our custom, <b>but</b> for this time we will lake you <b>on</b> our road, <b>and</b> you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.”
<br>   “O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,” said Pippin. Sam was speechless. “I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,” said Frodo bowing. “Elen s?la l?menn” omentielvo, a star shines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hour <b>of</b> our meeting,” he added in <b>the</b> high-elven speech.
<br>   “Be careful, friends!” cried Gildor laughing. “Speak <b>no</b> secrets! Here is a scholar in <b>the</b> Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail, Elf-friend!” he said, bowing <b>to</b> Frodo. “Come now with your friends <b>and</b> join our company! You had best walk in <b>the</b> middle so that you may not stray. You may be weary before we halt.”
<br>   “Why? Where are you going?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “For tonight we go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills above Woodhall. It is some miles, <b>but</b> you shall have rest at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will shorten your journey tomorrow.”
<br>   They now marched <b>on</b> again in silence, <b>and</b> passed like shadows <b>and</b> faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished without sound <b>or</b> footfall. Pippin soon began <b>to</b> feel sleepy, <b>and</b> staggered once <b>or</b> twice; <b>but</b> each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm <b>and</b> saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo’s side, as if in a dream, with an expression <b>on</b> his face half <b>of</b> fear <b>and</b> half <b>of</b> astonished joy.
<br>   The woods <b>on</b> either side became denser; <b>the</b> trees were now younger <b>and</b> thicker; <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> lane went lower, running down <b>into</b> a fold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, there were many deep brakes <b>of</b> hazel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rising slopes at either hand. At last <b>the</b> Elves turned aside from <b>the</b> path. A green ride lay almost unseen through <b>the</b> thickets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right; <b>and</b> this they followed as <b>it</b> wound away back up <b>the</b> wooded slopes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills that stood out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river-valley. Suddenly they came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> before them lay a wide space <b>of</b> grass, grey under <b>the</b> night. On three sides <b>the</b> woods pressed upon <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> eastward <b>the</b> ground fell steeply <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark trees, growing at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope, were below their feet. Beyond, <b>the</b> low lands lay dim <b>and</b> flat under <b>the</b> stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Woodhall.
<br>   The Elves sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass <b>and</b> spoke together in soft voices; they seemed <b>to</b> take <b>no</b> further notice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. Frodo <b>and</b> his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks <b>and</b> blankets, <b>and</b> drowsiness stole over them. The night grew <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lights in <b>the</b> valley went out. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed <b>on</b> a green hillock.
<br>   Away high in <b>the</b> East swung Remmirath, <b>the</b> Netted Stars, <b>and</b> slowly above <b>the</b> mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel <b>of</b> fire. Then <b>by</b> some shift <b>of</b> airs all <b>the</b> mist was drawn away like a veil, <b>and</b> there leaned up, as he climbed over <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>the</b> Swordsman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst <b>into</b> song. Suddenly under <b>the</b> trees a fire sprang up with a red light.
<br>   “Come!” <b>the</b> Elves called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “Come! Now is <b>the</b> time for speech <b>and</b> merriment!”
<br>   Pippin sat up <b>and</b> rubbed his eyes. He shivered. “There is a fire in <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> food for hungry guests,” said an Elf standing before him.
<br>   At <b>the</b> south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greensward there was an opening. There <b>the</b> green floor ran <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood, <b>and</b> formed a wide space like a hall, roofed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> boughs <b>of</b> trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side. In <b>the</b> middle there was a wood-fire blazing, <b>and</b> upon <b>the</b> tree-pillars torches with lights <b>of</b> gold <b>and</b> silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat round <b>the</b> fire upon <b>the</b> grass <b>or</b> upon <b>the</b> sawn rings <b>of</b> old trunks. Some went <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro bearing cups <b>and</b> pouring drink; others brought food <b>on</b> heaped plates <b>and</b> dishes.
<br>   “This is poor fare,” they said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits; “for we are lodging in <b>the</b> greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we will treat you better.”
<br>   “It seems <b>to</b> me good enough for a birthday-party,” said Frodo.
<br>   Pippin afterwards recalled little <b>of</b> either food <b>or</b> drink, for his mind was filled with <b>the</b> light upon <b>the</b> elf-faces, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> voices so various <b>and</b> so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered that there was bread, surpassing <b>the</b> savour <b>of</b> a fair white loaf <b>to</b> one who is starving; <b>and</b> fruits sweet as wildberries <b>and</b> richer than <b>the</b> tended fruits <b>of</b> gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon.
<br>   Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly <b>to</b> himself, what he felt <b>or</b> thought that night, though <b>it</b> remained in his memory as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief events <b>of</b> his life. The nearest he ever got was <b>to</b> say: “Well, sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> singing that went <b>to</b> my heart, if you know what I mean.”
<br>   Frodo sat, eating, drinking, <b>and</b> talking with delight; <b>but</b> his mind was chiefly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> words spoken. He knew a little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elf-speech <b>and</b> listened eagerly. Now <b>and</b> again he spoke <b>to</b> those that served him <b>and</b> thanked them in their own language. They smiled at him <b>and</b> said laughing: “Here is a jewel among hobbits!”
<br>   After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, <b>and</b> was lifted up <b>and</b> borne away <b>to</b> a bower under <b>the</b> trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed <b>and</b> slept <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night away. Sam refused <b>to</b> leave his master. When Pippin had gone, he came <b>and</b> sat curled up at Frodo’s feet, where at last he nodded <b>and</b> closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.
<br>   They spoke <b>of</b> many things, old <b>and</b> new, <b>and</b> Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings in <b>the</b> wide world outside <b>the</b> Shire. The tidings were mostly sad <b>and</b> ominous: <b>of</b> gathering darkness, <b>the</b> wars <b>of</b> Men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves. At last Frodo asked <b>the</b> question that was nearest <b>to</b> his heart:
<br>   “Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?”
<br>   Gildor smiled. “Yes,” he answered. “Twice. He said farewell <b>to</b> us <b>on</b> this very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.” He would say <b>no</b> more about Bilbo, <b>and</b> Frodo fell silent.
<br>   “You do not ask me <b>or</b> tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,” said Gildor. “But I already know a little, <b>and</b> I can read more in your face <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> thought behind your questions. You are leaving <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, <b>or</b> accomplish what you intend, <b>or</b> that you will ever return. Is not that so?”
<br>   “It is,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> I thought my going was a secret known only <b>to</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> my faithful Sam.” He looked down at Sam, who was snoring gently.
<br>   “The secret will not reach <b>the</b> Enemy from us,” said Gildor.
<br>   “The Enemy?” said Frodo. “Then you know why I am leaving <b>the</b> Shire?”
<br>   “I do not know for what reason <b>the</b> Enemy is pursuing you,” answered Gildor; “<b>but</b> I perceive that he is—strange indeed though that seems <b>to</b> me. And I warn you that peril is now both before you <b>and</b> behind you, <b>and</b> upon either side.”
<br>   “You mean <b>the</b> Riders? I feared that they were servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. What are <b>the</b> Black Riders?”
<br>   “Has Gandalf told you nothing?”
<br>   “Nothing about such creatures.”
<br>   “Then I think <b>it</b> is not for me <b>to</b> say more—lest terror should keep you from your journey. For <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> me that you have set out only just in time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, <b>and</b> neither stay nor turn back; for <b>the</b> Shire is <b>no</b> longer any protection <b>to</b> you.”
<br>   “I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints <b>and</b> warnings,” exclaimed Frodo. “I knew that danger lay ahead, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> I did not expect <b>to</b> meet <b>it</b> in our own Shire. Can’t a hobbit walk from <b>the</b> Water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River in peace?”
<br>   “But <b>it</b> is not your own Shire,” said Gildor. “Others dwelt here before hobbits were; <b>and</b> others will dwell here again when hobbits are <b>no</b> more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, <b>but</b> you cannot for ever fence <b>it</b> out.”
<br>   “I know—<b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> has always seemed so safe <b>and</b> familiar. What can I do now? My plan was <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire secretly, <b>and</b> make my way <b>to</b> Rivendell; <b>but</b> now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get <b>to</b> Buckland.”
<br>   “I think you should still follow that plan,” said Gildor. “I do not think <b>the</b> Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know <b>the</b> reason for your flight, <b>and</b> therefore I do not know <b>by</b> what means your pursuers will assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before you leave <b>the</b> Shire?”
<br>   “I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was <b>to</b> have come <b>to</b> Hobbiton at <b>the</b> latest two nights ago; <b>but</b> he has never appeared. Now I am wondering what can have happened. Should I wait for him?”
<br>   Gildor was silent for a moment. “I do not like this news,” he said at last. “That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But <b>it</b> is said: Do not meddle in <b>the</b> affairs <b>of</b> Wizards, for they are subtle <b>and</b> quick <b>to</b> anger. The choice is yours: <b>to</b> go <b>or</b> wait.”
<br>   “And <b>it</b> is also said,” answered Frodo: “Go not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elves for counsel, for they will say both <b>no</b> <b>and</b> yes.”
<br>   “Is <b>it</b> indeed?” laughed Gildor. “Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from <b>the</b> wise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wise, <b>and</b> all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; <b>and</b> how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand advice, I will for friendship’s sake give <b>it</b>. I think you should now go at once, without delay; <b>and</b> if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone. Take such friends as are trusty <b>and</b> willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. The Elves have their own labours <b>and</b> their own sorrows, <b>and</b> they are little concerned with <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> hobbits, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> any other creatures upon earth. Our paths cross theirs seldom, <b>by</b> chance <b>or</b> purpose. In this meeting there may be more than chance; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> purpose is not clear <b>to</b> me, <b>and</b> I fear <b>to</b> say too much.”
<br>   “I am deeply grateful,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> I wish you would tell me plainly what <b>the</b> Black Riders are. If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, <b>and</b> I ought <b>to</b> know what is <b>the</b> danger that pursues me.”
<br>   “Is <b>it</b> not enough <b>to</b> know that they are servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy?” answered Gildor. “Flee them! Speak <b>no</b> words <b>to</b> them! They are deadly. Ask <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo, will know more <b>of</b> these fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!”
<br>   “But where shall I find courage?” asked Frodo. “That is what I chiefly need.”
<br>   “Courage is found in unlikely places,” said Gildor. “Be <b>of</b> good hope! Sleep now! In <b>the</b> morning we shall have gone; <b>but</b> we will send our messages through <b>the</b> lands. The Wandering Companies shall know <b>of</b> your journey, <b>and</b> those that have power for good shall be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> watch. I name you Elf-friend; <b>and</b> may <b>the</b> stars shine upon <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your road! Seldom have we had such delight in strangers, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is fair <b>to</b> hear words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Speech from <b>the</b> lips <b>of</b> other wanderers in <b>the</b> world.”
<br>   Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. “I will sleep now,” he said; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elf led him <b>to</b> a bower beside Pippin, <b>and</b> he threw himself upon a bed <b>and</b> fell at once <b>into</b> a dreamless slumber.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS
<br>
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made <b>by</b> a living tree with branches laced <b>and</b> drooping <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground; his bed was <b>of</b> fern <b>and</b> grass, deep <b>and</b> soft <b>and</b> strangely fragrant. The sun was shining through <b>the</b> fluttering leaves, which were still green upon <b>the</b> tree. He jumped up <b>and</b> went out.
<br>   Sam was sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass near <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. Pippin was standing studying <b>the</b> sky <b>and</b> weather. There was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves.
<br>   “They have left us fruit <b>and</b> drink, <b>and</b> bread,” said Pippin. “Come <b>and</b> have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as <b>it</b> did last night. I did not want <b>to</b> leave you any, <b>but</b> Sam insisted.”
<br>   Frodo sat down beside Sam <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> eat. “What is <b>the</b> plan for today?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “To walk <b>to</b> Bucklebury as quickly as possible,” answered Frodo, <b>and</b> gave his attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> food.
<br>   “Do you think we shall see anything <b>of</b> those Riders?” asked Pippin cheerfully. Under <b>the</b> morning sun <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> seeing a whole troop <b>of</b> them did not seem very alarming <b>to</b> him.
<br>   “Yes, probably,” said Frodo, not liking <b>the</b> reminder. “But I hope <b>to</b> get across <b>the</b> river without their seeing us.”
<br>   “Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?”
<br>   “Not much—only hints <b>and</b> riddles,” said Frodo evasively. “Did you ask about <b>the</b> sniffing?”
<br>   “We didn’t discuss <b>it</b>,” said Frodo with his mouth full.
<br>   “You should have. I am sure <b>it</b> is very important.”
<br>   “In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused <b>to</b> explain <b>it</b>,” said Frodo sharply. “And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don’t want <b>to</b> answer a string <b>of</b> questions while I am eating. I want <b>to</b> think!”
<br>   “Good heavens!” said Pippin. “At breakfast?” He walked away towards <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green.
<br>   From Frodo’s mind <b>the</b> bright morning—treacherously bright, he thought—had not banished <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> pursuit; <b>and</b> he pondered <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Gildor. The merry voice <b>of</b> Pippin came <b>to</b> him. He was running <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green turf <b>and</b> singing.
<br>   “No! I could not!” he said <b>to</b> himself. “It is one thing <b>to</b> take my young friends walking over <b>the</b> Shire with me, until we are hungry <b>and</b> weary, <b>and</b> food <b>and</b> bed are sweet. To take them <b>into</b> exile, where hunger <b>and</b> weariness may have <b>no</b> cure, is quite another—even if they are willing <b>to</b> come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don’t think I ought even <b>to</b> take Sam.” He looked at Sam Gamgee, <b>and</b> discovered that Sam was watching him.
<br>   “Well, Sam!” he said. “What about <b>it</b>? I am leaving <b>the</b> Shire as soon as ever I can—in fact I have made up my mind now not even <b>to</b> wait a day at Crickhollow, if <b>it</b> can be helped.”
<br>   “Very good, sir!”
<br>   “You still mean <b>to</b> come with me?”
<br>   “I do.”
<br>   “It is going <b>to</b> be very dangerous, Sam. “It is already dangerous. Most likely neither <b>of</b> us will come back.”
<br>   “If you don’t come back, sir, then I shan’t, that’s certain,” said Sam. “Don’t you leave him! they said <b>to</b> me. Leave him! I said. I never mean <b>to</b>. I am going with him, if he climbs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon, <b>and</b> if any <b>of</b> those Black Rulers try <b>to</b> stop him, they’ll have Sam Gamgee <b>to</b> reckon with, I said. They laughed.”
<br>   “Who are they, <b>and</b> what are you talking about?”
<br>   “The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; <b>and</b> they seemed <b>to</b> know you were going away, so I didn’t see <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> denying <b>it</b>. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!”
<br>   “They are,” said Frodo. “Do you like them still, now you have had a closer view?”
<br>   “They seem a bit above my likes <b>and</b> dislikes, so <b>to</b> speak,” answered Sam slowly. “It don’t seem <b>to</b> matter what I think about them. They are quite different from what I expected—so old <b>and</b> young, <b>and</b> so gay <b>and</b> sad, as <b>it</b> were.”
<br>   Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting <b>to</b> see some outward sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> odd change that seemed <b>to</b> have come over him. It did not sound like <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But <b>it</b> looked like <b>the</b> old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful.
<br>   “Do you feel any need <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire now—now that your wish <b>to</b> see them has come true already?” he asked.
<br>   “Yes, sir. I don’t know how <b>to</b> say <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> after last night I feel different. I seem <b>to</b> see ahead, in a kind <b>of</b> way. I know we are going <b>to</b> take a very long road, <b>into</b> darkness; <b>but</b> I know I can’t turn back. It isn’t <b>to</b> see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want—I don’t rightly know what I want: <b>but</b> I have something <b>to</b> do before <b>the</b> end, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> lies ahead, not in <b>the</b> Shire. I must see <b>it</b> through, sir, if you understand me.”
<br>   “I don’t altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. I am content. We will go together.”
<br>   Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over <b>the</b> land ahead, <b>and</b> called <b>to</b> Pippin.
<br>   “All ready <b>to</b> start?” he said as Pippin ran up. “We must be getting off at once. We slept late; <b>and</b> there are a good many miles <b>to</b> go.”
<br>   “You slept late, you mean,” said Pippin. “I was up long before; <b>and</b> we are only waiting for you <b>to</b> finish eating <b>and</b> thinking.”
<br>   “I have finished both now. And I am going <b>to</b> make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. I am not going out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road we left last night: I am going <b>to</b> cut straight across country from here.”
<br>   “Then you are going <b>to</b> fly,” said Pippin. “You won’t cut straight <b>on</b> foot anywhere in this country.”
<br>   “We can cut straighter than <b>the</b> road anyway,” answered Frodo. “The Ferry is east from Woodhall; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hard road curves away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left—you can see a bend <b>of</b> <b>it</b> away north over there. It goes round <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish so as <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> causeway from <b>the</b> Bridge above Stock. But that is miles out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. We could save a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance if we made a line for <b>the</b> Ferry from where we stand.”
<br>   “Short cuts make long delays,” argued Pippin. “The country is rough round here, <b>and</b> there are bogs <b>and</b> all kinds <b>of</b> difficulties down in <b>the</b> Marish—I know <b>the</b> land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black Riders, I can’t see that <b>it</b> is any worse meeting them <b>on</b> a road than in a wood <b>or</b> a field.”
<br>   “It is less easy <b>to</b> find people in <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> fields,” answered Frodo. “And if you are supposed <b>to</b> be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road, there is some chance that you will be looked for <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> not off <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “All right!” said Pippin. “I will follow you <b>into</b> every bog <b>and</b> ditch. But <b>it</b> is hard! I had counted <b>on</b> passing <b>the</b> Golden Perch at Stock before sundown. The best beer in <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, <b>or</b> used <b>to</b> be: <b>it</b> is a long time since I tasted <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “That settles <b>it</b>!” said Frodo. “Short cuts make delays, <b>but</b> inns make longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from <b>the</b> Golden Perch. We want <b>to</b> get <b>to</b> Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?”
<br>   “I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,” said Sam (in spite <b>of</b> private misgiving <b>and</b> a deep regret for <b>the</b> best beer in <b>the</b> Eastfarthing).
<br>   “Then if we are going <b>to</b> toil through bog <b>and</b> briar, let’s go now!” said Pippin.
<br>   It was already nearly as hot as <b>it</b> had been <b>the</b> day before; <b>but</b> clouds were beginning <b>to</b> come up from <b>the</b> West. It looked likely <b>to</b> turn <b>to</b> rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank <b>and</b> plunged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> thick trees below. Their course had been chosen <b>to</b> leave Woodhall <b>to</b> their left, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> cut slanting through <b>the</b> woods that clustered along <b>the</b> eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, until they reached <b>the</b> flats beyond. Then they could make straight for <b>the</b> Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches <b>and</b> fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles <b>to</b> go in a straight line.
<br>   He soon found that <b>the</b> thicket was closer <b>and</b> more tangled than <b>it</b> had appeared. There were <b>no</b> paths in <b>the</b> undergrowth, <b>and</b> they did not get <b>on</b> very fast. When they had struggled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank, they found a stream running down from <b>the</b> hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently <b>it</b> cut across <b>the</b> line they had chosen. They could not jump over <b>it</b>, nor indeed get across <b>it</b> at all without getting wet, scratched, <b>and</b> muddy. They halted, wondering what <b>to</b> do. “First check!” said Pippin, smiling grimly.
<br>   Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in <b>the</b> trees he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green bank from which they had climbed down.
<br>   “Look!” he said, clutching Frodo <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arm. They all looked, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge high above them they saw against <b>the</b> sky a horse standing. Beside <b>it</b> stooped a black figure.
<br>   They at once gave up any idea <b>of</b> going back. Frodo led <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> plunged quickly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> thick bushes beside <b>the</b> stream. “Whew!” he said <b>to</b> Pippin. “We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; <b>but</b> we got under cover only just in time. You’ve got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear anything coming?”
<br>   They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; <b>but</b> there was <b>no</b> sound <b>of</b> pursuit. “I don’t fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank,” said Sam. “But I guess he knows we came down <b>it</b>. We had better be going <b>on</b>.”
<br>   Going <b>on</b> was not altogether easy. They had packs <b>to</b> carry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bushes <b>and</b> brambles were reluctant <b>to</b> let them through. They were cut off from <b>the</b> wind <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ridge behind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> air was still <b>and</b> stuffy. When they forced their way at last <b>into</b> more open ground, they were hot <b>and</b> tired <b>and</b> very scratched, <b>and</b> they were also <b>no</b> longer certain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direction in which they were going. The banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream sank, as <b>it</b> reached <b>the</b> levels <b>and</b> became broader <b>and</b> shallower, wandering off towards <b>the</b> Marish <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River.
<br>   “Why, this is <b>the</b> Stock-brook!” said Pippin. “If we are going <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> get back <b>on</b> <b>to</b> our course, we must cross at once <b>and</b> bear right.”
<br>   They waded <b>the</b> stream, <b>and</b> hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown <b>and</b> treeless, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> further side. Beyond that they came again <b>to</b> a belt <b>of</b> trees: tall oaks, for <b>the</b> most part, with here <b>and</b> there an elm tree <b>or</b> an ash. The ground was fairly level, <b>and</b> there was little undergrowth; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> trees were loo close for them <b>to</b> see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts <b>of</b> wind, <b>and</b> spots <b>of</b> rain began <b>to</b> fall from <b>the</b> overcast sky. Then <b>the</b> wind died away <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rain came streaming down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches <b>of</b> grass, <b>and</b> through thick drifts <b>of</b> old leaves; <b>and</b> all about them <b>the</b> rain pattered <b>and</b> trickled. They did not talk, <b>but</b> kept glancing back, <b>and</b> from side <b>to</b> side.
<br>   After half an hour Pippin said: “I hope we have not turned too much towards <b>the</b> south, <b>and</b> are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not a very broad belt –I should have said <b>no</b> more than a mile at <b>the</b> widest—<b>and</b> we ought <b>to</b> have been through <b>it</b> <b>by</b> now.”
<br>   “It is <b>no</b> good our starting <b>to</b> go in zig-zags,” said Frodo. “That won’t mend matters. Let us keep <b>on</b> as we are going! I am not sure that I want <b>to</b> come out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open yet.”
<br>   They went <b>on</b> for perhaps another couple <b>of</b> miles. Then <b>the</b> sun gleamed out <b>of</b> ragged clouds again <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rain lessened. It was now past mid-day, <b>and</b> they felt <b>it</b> was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground at its feel was fairly dry <b>and</b> sheltered. When they came <b>to</b> make their meal, they found that <b>the</b> Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: <b>it</b> had <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> a honey made <b>of</b> many flowers, <b>and</b> was wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, <b>and</b> snapping their fingers at rain, <b>and</b> at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them.
<br>   Frodo propped his back against <b>the</b> tree-trunk, <b>and</b> closed his eyes. Sam <b>and</b> Pippin sat near, <b>and</b> they began <b>to</b> hum, <b>and</b> then <b>to</b> sing softly:
<br>   
<br>Ho! Ho! Ho! <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottle I go
<br>To heal my heart <b>and</b> drown my woe.
<br>Rain may fall <b>and</b> wind may blow,
<br>And many miles be still <b>to</b> go,
<br>But under a tall tree I will lie,
<br>And let <b>the</b> clouds go sailing <b>by</b>.
<br>   
<br>   Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang <b>to</b> his feet. A long-drawn wail came down <b>the</b> wind, like <b>the</b> cry <b>of</b> some evil <b>and</b> lonely creature. It rose <b>and</b> fell, <b>and</b> ended <b>on</b> a high piercing note. Even as they sat <b>and</b> stood, as if suddenly frozen, <b>it</b> was answered <b>by</b> another cry, fainter <b>and</b> further off, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> less chilling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blood. There was then a silence, broken only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind in <b>the</b> leaves.
<br>   “And what do you think that was?” Pippin asked at last, trying <b>to</b> speak lightly, <b>but</b> quavering a little. “If <b>it</b> was a bird, <b>it</b> was one that I never heard in <b>the</b> Shire before.”
<br>   “It was not bird <b>or</b> beast,” said Frodo. “It was a call, <b>or</b> a signal—there were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But <b>no</b> hobbit has such a voice.”
<br>   No more was said about <b>it</b>. They were all thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> one spoke <b>of</b> them. They were now reluctant either <b>to</b> stay <b>or</b> go <b>on</b>; <b>but</b> sooner <b>or</b> later they had got <b>to</b> get across <b>the</b> open country <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was best <b>to</b> go sooner <b>and</b> in daylight. In a few moments they had shouldered their packs again <b>and</b> were off.
<br>   Before long <b>the</b> wood came <b>to</b> a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. Away over <b>the</b> flats they could glimpse <b>the</b> low hill <b>of</b> Bucklebury across <b>the</b> River, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was now <b>to</b> their left. Creeping cautiously out from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, they set off across <b>the</b> open as quickly as they could.
<br>   At first they felt afraid, away from <b>the</b> shelter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. Far back behind them stood <b>the</b> high place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half expected <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> small distant figure <b>of</b> a horseman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge dark against <b>the</b> sky; <b>but</b> there was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> one. The sun escaping from <b>the</b> breaking clouds, as <b>it</b> sank towards <b>the</b> hills they had left, was now shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But <b>the</b> land became steadily more tame <b>and</b> well-ordered. Soon they came <b>into</b> well-tended fields <b>and</b> meadows: there were hedges <b>and</b> gates <b>and</b> dikes for drainage. Everything seemed quiet <b>and</b> peaceful, just an ordinary corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River grew nearer; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders began <b>to</b> seem like phantoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods now left far behind.
<br>   They passed along <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a huge turnip-field, <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> a stout gate. Beyond <b>it</b> a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump <b>of</b> trees. Pippin stopped.
<br>   “I know these fields <b>and</b> this gate!” he said. “This is Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot’s land. That’s his farm away there in <b>the</b> trees.”
<br>   “One trouble after another!” said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared <b>the</b> lane was <b>the</b> slot leading <b>to</b> a dragon’s den. The others looked at him in surprise.
<br>   “What’s wrong with old Maggot?” asked Pippin. “He’s a good friend <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> Brandy bucks. Of course he’s a terror <b>to</b> trespassers, <b>and</b> keeps ferocious dogs—<b>but</b> after all, folk down here are near <b>the</b> border <b>and</b> have <b>to</b> be more <b>on</b> their guard.”
<br>   “I know,” said Frodo. “But all <b>the</b> same,” he added with a shamefaced laugh, “I am terrified <b>of</b> him <b>and</b> his dogs. I have avoided his farm for years <b>and</b> years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On <b>the</b> last occasion he beat me, <b>and</b> then took me <b>and</b> showed me <b>to</b> his dogs. “See, lads,” he said, “next time this young varmint sets foot <b>on</b> my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!” They chased me all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry. I have never got over <b>the</b> fright—though I daresay <b>the</b> beasts knew their business <b>and</b> would not really have touched me.”
<br>   Pippin laughed. “Well, <b>it</b>’s time you made <b>it</b> up. Especially if you are coming back <b>to</b> live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout fellow—if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let’s get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane <b>and</b> then we shan’t be trespassing. If we meet him, I’ll do <b>the</b> talking. He is a friend <b>of</b> Merry’s, <b>and</b> I used <b>to</b> come here with him a good deal at one time.”
<br>   They went along <b>the</b> lane, until they saw <b>the</b> thatched roofs <b>of</b> a large house <b>and</b> farm-buildings peeping out among <b>the</b> trees ahead. The Maggots, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Puddifoots <b>of</b> Stock, <b>and</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish, were house-dwellers; <b>and</b> this farm was stoutly built <b>of</b> brick <b>and</b> had a high wall all round <b>it</b>. There was a wide wooden gate opening out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane.
<br>   Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying <b>and</b> barking broke out, <b>and</b> a loud voice was heard shouting: “Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come <b>on</b>, lads!”
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Sam stopped dead, <b>but</b> Pippin walked <b>on</b> a few paces. The gate opened <b>and</b> three huge dogs came pelting out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane, <b>and</b> dashed towards <b>the</b> travellers, barking fiercely. They took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> Pippin; <b>but</b> Sam shrank against <b>the</b> wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, <b>and</b> snarled if he moved. The largest <b>and</b> most ferocious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three halted in front <b>of</b> Frodo, bristling <b>and</b> growling.
<br>   Through <b>the</b> gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit with a round red face. “Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, <b>and</b> what may you be wanting?” he asked.
<br>   “Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!” said Pippin.
<br>   The farmer looked at him closely. “Well, if <b>it</b> isn’t Master Pippin—Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!” he cried, changing from a scowl <b>to</b> a grin. “It’s a long time since I saw you round here. It’s lucky for you that I know you. I was just going out <b>to</b> set my dogs <b>on</b> any strangers. There are some funny things going <b>on</b> today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times. Too near <b>the</b> River,” he said, shaking his head. “But this fellow was <b>the</b> most outlandish I have ever set eyes <b>on</b>. He won’t cross my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “What fellow do you mean?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “Then you haven’t seen him?” said <b>the</b> farmer. “He went up <b>the</b> lane towards <b>the</b> causeway not a long while back. He was a funny customer <b>and</b> asking funny questions. But perhaps you’ll come along inside, <b>and</b> we’ll pass <b>the</b> news more comfortable. I’ve a drop <b>of</b> good ale <b>on</b> tap, if you <b>and</b> your friends are willing, Mr. Took.”
<br>   It seemed plain that <b>the</b> farmer would tell them more, if allowed <b>to</b> do <b>it</b> in his own time <b>and</b> fashion, so they all accepted <b>the</b> invitation. “What about <b>the</b> dogs?” asked Frodo anxiously.
<br>   The farmer laughed. “They won’t harm you—not unless I tell “em <b>to</b>. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!” he cried. “Heel, Wolf!” To <b>the</b> relief <b>of</b> Frodo <b>and</b> Sam, <b>the</b> dogs walked away <b>and</b> let them go free.
<br>   Pippin introduced <b>the</b> other two <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farmer. “Mr. Frodo Baggins,” he said. “You may not remember him, <b>but</b> he used <b>to</b> live at Brandy Hall.” At <b>the</b> name Baggins <b>the</b> farmer started, <b>and</b> gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment Frodo thought that <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> stolen mushrooms had been aroused, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> dogs would be told <b>to</b> see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arm.
<br>   “Well, if that isn’t queerer than ever?” he exclaimed. “Mr. Baggins is <b>it</b>? Come inside! We must have a talk.”
<br>   They went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> farmer’s kitchen, <b>and</b> sat <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, <b>and</b> filled four large mugs. It was a good brew, <b>and</b> Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing <b>the</b> Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural mistrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire; <b>and</b> also he was not disposed <b>to</b> be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however long ago.
<br>   After a few remarks about <b>the</b> weather <b>and</b> <b>the</b> agricultural prospects (which were <b>no</b> worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug <b>and</b> looked at them all in turn.
<br>   “Now, Mr. Peregrin,” he said, “where might you be coming from, <b>and</b> where might you be going <b>to</b>? Were you coming <b>to</b> visit” me? For, if so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you.”
<br>   “Well, <b>no</b>,” answered Pippin. “To tell you <b>the</b> truth, since you have guessed <b>it</b>, we got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane from <b>the</b> other end: we had come over your fields. But that was quite <b>by</b> accident. We lost our way in <b>the</b> woods, back near Woodhall, trying <b>to</b> take a short cut <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry.”
<br>   “If you were in a hurry, <b>the</b> road would have served you better,” said <b>the</b> farmer. “But I wasn’t worrying about that. You have leave <b>to</b> walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins—though I daresay you still like mushrooms.” He laughed. “Ah yes, I recognized <b>the</b> name. I recollect <b>the</b> time when young Frodo Baggins was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst young rascals <b>of</b> Buckland. But <b>it</b> wasn’t mushrooms I was thinking <b>of</b>. I had just heard <b>the</b> name Baggins before you turned up. What do you think that funny customer asked me?”
<br>   They waited anxiously for him <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>. “Well,” <b>the</b> farmer continued, approaching his point with slow relish, “he came riding <b>on</b> a big black horse in at <b>the</b> gate, which happened <b>to</b> be open, <b>and</b> right up <b>to</b> my door. All black he was himself, too, <b>and</b> cloaked <b>and</b> hooded up, as if he did not want <b>to</b> be known. “Now what in <b>the</b> Shire can he want?” I thought <b>to</b> myself. We don’t see many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Folk over <b>the</b> border; <b>and</b> anyway I had never heard <b>of</b> any like this black fellow.
<br>   ““Good-day <b>to</b> you!” I says, going out <b>to</b> him. “This lane don’t lead anywhere, <b>and</b> wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road.” I didn’t like <b>the</b> looks <b>of</b> him; <b>and</b> when Grip came out, he took one sniff <b>and</b> let out a yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail <b>and</b> bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still.
<br>   ““I come from yonder,” he said, slow <b>and</b> stiff-like, pointing back west, over my fields, if you please. “Have you seen Baggins?” he asked in a queer voice, <b>and</b> bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; <b>and</b> I felt a sort <b>of</b> shiver down my back. But I did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold.
<br>   ““Be off!” I said. “There are <b>no</b> Bagginses here. You’re in <b>the</b> wrong part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. You had better go back west <b>to</b> Hobbiton—<b>but</b> you can go <b>by</b> road this time.”
<br>   ““Baggins has left,” he answered in a whisper. “He is coming. He is not far away. I wish <b>to</b> find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come back with gold.”
<br>   ““No you won’t,” I said. “You’ll go back where you belong, double quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.”
<br>   “He gave a sort <b>of</b> hiss. It might have been laughing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> might not. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, <b>and</b> I jumped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way only just in time. I called <b>the</b> dogs, <b>but</b> he swung off, <b>and</b> rode through <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> lane towards <b>the</b> causeway like a bolt <b>of</b> thunder. What do you think <b>of</b> that?”
<br>   Frodo sat for a moment looking at <b>the</b> fire, <b>but</b> his only thought was how <b>on</b> earth would they reach <b>the</b> Ferry. “I don’t know what <b>to</b> think,” he said at last.
<br>   “Then I’ll tell you what <b>to</b> think,” said Maggot. “You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up there.” Sam stirred in his chair, <b>and</b> looked at <b>the</b> farmer with an unfriendly eye. “But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had left <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>and</b> gone off <b>to</b> that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you were going <b>to</b> find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes <b>of</b> those strange doings <b>of</b> Mr. Bilbo’s. His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want <b>to</b> know what has become <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gold <b>and</b> jewels that he buried in <b>the</b> hill <b>of</b> Hobbiton, as I hear?”
<br>   Frodo said nothing: <b>the</b> shrewd guesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmer were rather disconcerting.
<br>   “Well, Mr. Frodo,” Maggot went <b>on</b>, “I’m glad that you’ve had <b>the</b> sense <b>to</b> come back <b>to</b> Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don’t get mixed up with these outlandish folk. You’ll have friends in these parts. If any <b>of</b> these black fellows come after you again, I’ll deal with them. I’ll say you’re dead, <b>or</b> have left <b>the</b> Shire, <b>or</b> anything you like. And that might be true enough; for as like as not <b>it</b> is old Mr. Bilbo they want news <b>of</b>.”
<br>   “Maybe you’re right,” said Frodo, avoiding <b>the</b> farmer’s eye <b>and</b> staring at <b>the</b> fire.
<br>   Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. “Well, I see you have ideas <b>of</b> your own,” he said. “It is as plain as my nose that <b>no</b> accident brought you <b>and</b> that rider here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same afternoon; <b>and</b> maybe my news was <b>no</b> great news <b>to</b> you, after all. I am not asking you <b>to</b> tell me anything you have a mind <b>to</b> keep <b>to</b> yourself; <b>but</b> I see you are in some kind <b>of</b> trouble. Perhaps you are thinking <b>it</b> won’t be too easy <b>to</b> get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry without being caught?”
<br>   “I was thinking so,” said Frodo. “But we have got <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> get there; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> won’t be done <b>by</b> sitting <b>and</b> thinking. So I am afraid we must be going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I’ve been in terror <b>of</b> you <b>and</b> your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b>. It’s a pity: for I’ve missed a good friend. And now I’m sorry <b>to</b> leave so soon. But I’ll come back, perhaps, one day—if I get a chance.”
<br>   “You’ll be welcome when you come,” said Maggot. “But now I’ve a notion. It’s near sundown already, <b>and</b> we are going <b>to</b> have our supper; for we mostly go <b>to</b> bed soon after <b>the</b> Sun. If you <b>and</b> Mr. Peregrin <b>and</b> all could stay <b>and</b> have a bite with us, we would be pleased!”
<br>   “And so should we!” said Frodo. “But we must be going at once, I’m afraid. Even now <b>it</b> will be dark before we can reach <b>the</b> Ferry.”
<br>   “Ah! <b>but</b> wait a minute! I was going <b>to</b> say: after a bit <b>of</b> supper, I’ll gel out a small waggon, <b>and</b> I’ll drive you all <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry. That will save you a good step, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> might also save you trouble <b>of</b> another sort.”
<br>   Frodo now accepted <b>the</b> invitation gratefully, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relief <b>of</b> Pippin <b>and</b> Sam. The sun was already behind <b>the</b> western hills, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light was failing. Two <b>of</b> Maggot’s sons <b>and</b> his three daughters came in, <b>and</b> a generous supper was laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> large table. The kitchen was lit with candles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot hustled in <b>and</b> out. One <b>or</b> two other hobbits belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farm-household came in. In a short while fourteen sat down <b>to</b> eat. There was beer in plenty, <b>and</b> a mighty dish <b>of</b> mushrooms <b>and</b> bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> gnawed rinds <b>and</b> cracked bones.
<br>   When they had finished, <b>the</b> farmer <b>and</b> his sons went out with a lantern <b>and</b> got <b>the</b> waggon ready. It was dark in <b>the</b> yard, when <b>the</b> guests came out. They threw their packs <b>on</b> board <b>and</b> climbed in. The farmer sat in <b>the</b> driving-seat, <b>and</b> whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open door.
<br>   “You be careful <b>of</b> yourself. Maggot!” she called. “Don’t go arguing with any foreigners, <b>and</b> come straight back!”
<br>   “I will!” said he, <b>and</b> drove out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate. There was now <b>no</b> breath <b>of</b> wind stirring; <b>the</b> night was still <b>and</b> quiet, <b>and</b> a chill was in <b>the</b> air. They went without lights <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> slowly. After a mile <b>or</b> two <b>the</b> lane came <b>to</b> an end, crossing a deep dike, <b>and</b> climbing a short slope up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high-banked causeway.
<br>   Maggot got down <b>and</b> took a good look either way, north <b>and</b> south, <b>but</b> nothing could be seen in <b>the</b> darkness, <b>and</b> there was not a sound in <b>the</b> still air. Thin strands <b>of</b> river-mist were hanging above <b>the</b> dikes, <b>and</b> crawling over <b>the</b> fields.
<br>   “It’s going <b>to</b> be thick,” said Maggot; “<b>but</b> I’ll not light my lantern till I turn for home. We’ll hear anything <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road long before we meet <b>it</b> tonight.”
<br>   It was five miles <b>or</b> more from Maggot’s lane <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, <b>but</b> their ears were strained for any sound above <b>the</b> creak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slow clop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ponies” hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail <b>to</b> Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep; <b>but</b> Sam was staring forwards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rising fog.
<br>   They reached <b>the</b> entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry lane at last. It was marked <b>by</b> two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up <b>on</b> their right. Farmer Maggot drew in his ponies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> waggon creaked <b>to</b> a halt. They were just beginning lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading: hoofs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road ahead. The sound was coming towards them.
<br>   Maggot jumped down <b>and</b> stood holding <b>the</b> ponies” heads, <b>and</b> peering forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came <b>the</b> approaching rider. The fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hoofs sounded loud in <b>the</b> still, foggy air.
<br>   “You’d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,” said Sam anxiously. “You get down in <b>the</b> waggon <b>and</b> cover up with blankets, <b>and</b> we’ll send this rider <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rightabouts!” He climbed out <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farmer’s side. Black Riders would have <b>to</b> ride over him <b>to</b> get near <b>the</b> waggon.
<br>   Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly <b>on</b> them.
<br>   “Hallo there!” called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in <b>the</b> mist, a yard <b>or</b> two ahead. “Now then!” said <b>the</b> farmer, throwing <b>the</b> reins <b>to</b> Sam <b>and</b> striding forward. “Don’t you come a step nearer! What do you want, <b>and</b> where are you going?”
<br>   “I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?” said a muffled voice—<b>but</b> <b>the</b> voice was <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, <b>and</b> its light fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> astonished face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmer.
<br>   “Mr. Merry!” he cried.
<br>   “Yes, <b>of</b> course! Who did you think <b>it</b> was?” said Merry coming forward. As he came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mist <b>and</b> their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly <b>to</b> diminish <b>to</b> ordinary hobbit-size. He was riding a pony, <b>and</b> a scarf was swathed round his neck <b>and</b> over his chin <b>to</b> keep out <b>the</b> fog.
<br>   Frodo sprang out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waggon <b>to</b> greet him. “So there you are at last!” said Merry. “I was beginning <b>to</b> wonder if you would turn up at all today, <b>and</b> I was just going back <b>to</b> supper. When <b>it</b> grew foggy I came across <b>and</b> rode up towards Stock <b>to</b> see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I’m blest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In your duck-pond?”
<br>   “No, I caught “em trespassing,” said <b>the</b> farmer, “<b>and</b> nearly set my dogs <b>on</b> “em; <b>but</b> they’ll tell you all <b>the</b> story, I’ve <b>no</b> doubt. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Mr. Merry <b>and</b> Mr. Frodo <b>and</b> all, I’d best be turning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with <b>the</b> night getting thick.”
<br>   He backed <b>the</b> waggon <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane <b>and</b> turned <b>it</b>. “Well, good night <b>to</b> you all,” he said. “It’s been a queer day, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake. But all’s well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors. I’ll not deny that I’ll be glad now when I do.” He lit his lanterns, <b>and</b> got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under <b>the</b> seat. “I was nearly forgetting,” he said. “Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with her compliments.” He handed <b>it</b> down <b>and</b> moved off, followed <b>by</b> a chorus <b>of</b> thanks <b>and</b> good-nights.
<br>   They watched <b>the</b> pale rings <b>of</b> light round his lanterns as they dwindled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from <b>the</b> covered basket he held, <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> mushrooms was rising.
<br>

<br>Chapter 5
<br>A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED
<br>
<br>   “Now we had better get home ourselves,” said Merry. There’s something funny about all this, I see; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> must wait till we get in.”
<br>   They turned down <b>the</b> Ferry lane, which was straight <b>and</b> well-kept <b>and</b> edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> brought them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river-bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry-boat was moored beside <b>it</b>. The white bollards near <b>the</b> water’s edge glimmered in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> two lamps <b>on</b> high posts. Behind them <b>the</b> mists in <b>the</b> flat fields were now above <b>the</b> hedges; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> water before them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among <b>the</b> reeds <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bank. There seemed <b>to</b> be less fog <b>on</b> <b>the</b> further side.
<br>   Merry led <b>the</b> pony over a gangway <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ferry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow <b>and</b> broad before them. On <b>the</b> other side <b>the</b> bank was steep, <b>and</b> up <b>it</b> a winding path climbed from <b>the</b> further landing. Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up <b>the</b> Buck Hill; <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, through stray shrouds <b>of</b> mist, shone many round windows, yellow <b>and</b> red. They were <b>the</b> windows <b>of</b> Brandy Hall, <b>the</b> ancient home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandybucks.
<br>   Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oldbuck family, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest in <b>the</b> Marish <b>or</b> indeed in <b>the</b> Shire, had crossed <b>the</b> river, which was <b>the</b> original boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land eastwards. He built (<b>and</b> excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name <b>to</b> Brandybuck, <b>and</b> settled down <b>to</b> become master <b>of</b> what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew <b>and</b> grew, <b>and</b> after his days continued <b>to</b> grow, until Brandy Hall occupied <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low hill, <b>and</b> had three large front-doors, many side-doors, <b>and</b> about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks <b>and</b> their numerous dependants then began <b>to</b> burrow, <b>and</b> later <b>to</b> build, all round about. That was <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest, a sort <b>of</b> colony from <b>the</b> Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, clustering in <b>the</b> banks <b>and</b> slopes behind Brandy Hall.
<br>   The people in <b>the</b> Marish were friendly with <b>the</b> Bucklanders, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hall (as <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandybuck family was called) was still acknowledged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> farmers between Stock <b>and</b> Rushey. But most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Shire regarded <b>the</b> Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as <b>it</b> were. Though, as a matter <b>of</b> fact, they were not very different from <b>the</b> other hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond <b>of</b> boats, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> them could swim.
<br>   Their land was originally unprotected from <b>the</b> East; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> that side they had built a hedge: <b>the</b> High Hay. It had been planted many generations ago, <b>and</b> was now thick <b>and</b> tail, for <b>it</b> was constantly tended. It ran all <b>the</b> way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from <b>the</b> river, <b>to</b> Haysend (where <b>the</b> Withywindle flowed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end <b>to</b> end. But, <b>of</b> course, <b>it</b> was not a complete protection. The Forest drew close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hedge in many places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, <b>and</b> that also was not usual in <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   The ferry-boat moved slowly across <b>the</b> water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam was <b>the</b> only member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party who had not been over <b>the</b> river before. He had a strange feeling as <b>the</b> slow gurgling stream slipped <b>by</b>: his old life lay behind in <b>the</b> mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched his head, <b>and</b> for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone <b>on</b> living quietly at Bag End.
<br>   The four hobbits stepped off <b>the</b> ferry. Merry was tying <b>it</b> up, <b>and</b> Pippin was already leading <b>the</b> pony up <b>the</b> path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if <b>to</b> take farewell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:
<br>   “Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?”
<br>   On <b>the</b> far stage, under <b>the</b> distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: <b>it</b> looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> move <b>and</b> sway this way <b>and</b> that, as if searching <b>the</b> ground. It then crawled, <b>or</b> went crouching, back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom beyond <b>the</b> lamps.
<br>   “What in <b>the</b> Shire is that?” exclaimed Merry.
<br>   “Something that is following us,” said Frodo. “But don’t ask any more now! Let’s get away at once!” They hurried up <b>the</b> path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank, <b>but</b> when they looked back <b>the</b> far shore was shrouded in mist, <b>and</b> nothing could be seen.
<br>   “Thank goodness you don’t keep any boats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west-bank!” said Frodo. “Can horses cross <b>the</b> river?”
<br>   “They can go twenty miles north <b>to</b> Brandywine Bridge—<b>or</b> they might swim,” answered Merry. “Though I never heard <b>of</b> any horse swimming <b>the</b> Brandywine. But what have horses <b>to</b> do with <b>it</b>?” I’ll tell you later. Let’s get indoors <b>and</b> then we can talk.”
<br>   “All right! You <b>and</b> Pippin know your way; so I’ll just ride <b>on</b> <b>and</b> tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We’ll see about supper <b>and</b> things.”
<br>   “We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> we could do with another.”
<br>   “You shall have <b>it</b>! Give me that basket!” said Merry, <b>and</b> rode ahead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   It was some distance from <b>the</b> Brandywine <b>to</b> Frodo’s new house at Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill <b>and</b> Brandy Hall <b>on</b> their left, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> Bucklebury struck <b>the</b> main road <b>of</b> Buckland that ran south from <b>the</b> Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came <b>to</b> a lane opening <b>on</b> their right. This they followed for a couple <b>of</b> miles as <b>it</b> climbed up <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country.
<br>   At last they came <b>to</b> a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be seen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house in <b>the</b> dark: <b>it</b> stood back from <b>the</b> lane in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> a wide circle <b>of</b> lawn surrounded <b>by</b> a belt <b>of</b> low trees inside <b>the</b> outer hedge. Frodo had chosen <b>it</b>, because <b>it</b> stood in an out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, <b>and</b> there were <b>no</b> other dwellings close <b>by</b>. You could get in <b>and</b> out without being noticed. It had been built a long while before <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brandybucks, for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> guests, <b>or</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family that wished <b>to</b> escape from <b>the</b> crowded life <b>of</b> Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: <b>it</b> was long <b>and</b> low, with <b>no</b> upper storey; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> had a roof <b>of</b> turf, round windows, <b>and</b> a large round door.
<br>   As they walked lip <b>the</b> green path from <b>the</b> gate <b>no</b> light was visible; <b>the</b> windows were dark <b>and</b> shuttered. Frodo knocked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> Fatty Bolger opened <b>it</b>. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly <b>and</b> shut themselves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors <b>on</b> either side; in front <b>of</b> them a passage ran back down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house.
<br>   “Well, what do you think <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?” asked Merry coming up <b>the</b> passage. “We have done our best in a short time <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> look like home. After all Fatty <b>and</b> I only got here with <b>the</b> last cart-load yesterday.”
<br>   Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many <b>of</b> his own favourite things—<b>or</b> Bilbo’s things (they reminded him sharply <b>of</b> him in their new selling)—were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; <b>and</b> he found himself wishing that he was really coming here <b>to</b> settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed unfair <b>to</b> have put his friends <b>to</b> all this trouble; <b>and</b> he wondered again how he was going <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> news <b>to</b> them that he must leave them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have <b>to</b> be done that very night, before they all went <b>to</b> bed.
<br>   “It’s delightful!” he said with an effort. “I hardly feel that I have moved at all.”
<br>   The travellers hung up their cloaks, <b>and</b> piled their packs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Merry led them down <b>the</b> passage <b>and</b> threw open a door at <b>the</b> far end. Firelight came out, <b>and</b> a puff <b>of</b> steam.
<br>   “A bath!” cried Pippin. “O blessed Meriadoc!”
<br>   “Which order shall we go in?” said Frodo. “Eldest first, <b>or</b> quickest first? You’ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.”
<br>   “Trust me <b>to</b> arrange things better than that!” said Merry. “We can’t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are three tubs, <b>and</b> a copper full <b>of</b> boiling water. There are also towels, mats <b>and</b> soap. Get inside, <b>and</b> be quick!”
<br>   Merry <b>and</b> Fatty went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage, <b>and</b> busied themselves with <b>the</b> final preparations for a late supper. Snatches <b>of</b> competing songs came from <b>the</b> bathroom mixed with <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> splashing <b>and</b> wallowing. The voice <b>of</b> Pippin was suddenly lifted up above <b>the</b> others in one <b>of</b> Bilbo’s favourite bath-songs.
<br>   
<br>Sing hey! for <b>the</b> bath at close <b>of</b> day
<br>that washes <b>the</b> weary mud away!
<br>A loon is he that will not sing:
<br>O! Water Hot is a noble thing!
<br>
<br>O! Sweet is <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> falling rain,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> brook that leaps from hill <b>to</b> plain;
<br><b>but</b> better than rain <b>or</b> rippling streams
<br>is Water Hot that smokes <b>and</b> steams.
<br>
<br>O! Water cold we may pour at need
<br>down a thirsty throat <b>and</b> be glad indeed;
<br><b>but</b> better is Beer, if drink we lack,
<br><b>and</b> Water Hot poured down <b>the</b> back.
<br>
<br>O! Water is fair that leaps <b>on</b> high
<br>in a fountain white beneath <b>the</b> sky;
<br><b>but</b> never did fountain sound so sweet
<br>as splashing Hot Water with my feet!
<br>   
<br>   There was a terrific splash, <b>and</b> a shout <b>of</b> Whoa! from Frodo. It appeared that a lot <b>of</b> Pippin’s bath had imitated a fountain <b>and</b> leaped <b>on</b> high.
<br>   Merry went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door: “What about supper <b>and</b> beer in <b>the</b> throat?” he called. Frodo came out drying his hair.
<br>   “There’s so much water in <b>the</b> air that I’m coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>to</b> finish,” he said.
<br>   “Lawks!” said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming. “You ought <b>to</b> mop all that up before you get anything <b>to</b> eat. Peregrin,” he said. “Hurry up, <b>or</b> we shan’t wait for you.”
<br>   They had supper in <b>the</b> kitchen <b>on</b> a table near <b>the</b> fire. “I suppose you three won’t want mushrooms again?” said Fredegar without much hope.
<br>   “Yes we shall!” cried Pippin.
<br>   “They’re mine!” said Frodo. “Given <b>to</b> me <b>by</b> Mrs. Maggot, a queen among farmers” wives. Take your greedy hands away, <b>and</b> I’ll serve them.”
<br>   Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even <b>the</b> greediest likings <b>of</b> Big People. A fact which partly explains young Frodo’s long expeditions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> renowned fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wrath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according <b>to</b> hobbit standards. There were also many other things <b>to</b> follow, <b>and</b> when they had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh <b>of</b> content. They pushed back <b>the</b> table, <b>and</b> drew chairs round <b>the</b> fire.
<br>   “We’ll clear up later,” said Merry. “Now tell me all about <b>it</b>! I guess that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I want a full account; <b>and</b> most <b>of</b> all I want <b>to</b> know what was <b>the</b> matter with old Maggot, <b>and</b> why he spoke <b>to</b> me like that. He sounded almost as if he was scared, if that is possible.”
<br>   “We have all been scared,” said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> did not speak. “You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days <b>by</b> Black Riders.”
<br>   “And what are they?”
<br>   “Black figures riding <b>on</b> black horses,” answered Pippin. “If Frodo won’t talk, I will tell you <b>the</b> whole tale from <b>the</b> beginning.” He then gave a full account <b>of</b> their journey from <b>the</b> time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods <b>and</b> exclamations. Frodo remained silent.
<br>   “I should think you were making <b>it</b> all up,” said Merry, “if I had not seen that black shape <b>on</b> <b>the</b> landing-stage—<b>and</b> heard <b>the</b> queer sound in Maggot’s voice. What do you make <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all, Frodo?”
<br>   “Cousin Frodo has been very close,” said Pippin. “But <b>the</b> time has come for him <b>to</b> open out. So far we have been given nothing more <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> than Farmer Maggot’s guess that <b>it</b> has something <b>to</b> do with old Bilbo’s treasure.”
<br>   “That was only a guess,” said Frodo hastily. “Maggot does not know anything.”
<br>   “Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,” said Merry. “A lot goes <b>on</b> behind his round face that does not come out in his talk. I’ve heard that he used <b>to</b> go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest at one time, <b>and</b> he has <b>the</b> reputation <b>of</b> knowing a good many strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good <b>or</b> bad.”
<br>   “I think,” answered Frodo slowly, “that <b>it</b> was a good guess, as far as <b>it</b> goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo’s old adventures, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Riders are looking, <b>or</b> perhaps one ought <b>to</b> say searching, for him <b>or</b> for me. I also fear, if you want <b>to</b> know, that <b>it</b> is <b>no</b> joke at all; <b>and</b> that I am not safe here <b>or</b> anywhere else.” He looked round at <b>the</b> windows <b>and</b> walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in silence, <b>and</b> exchanged meaning glances among themselves.
<br>   “It’s coming out in a minute,” whispered Pippin <b>to</b> Merry. Merry nodded.
<br>   “Well!” said Frodo at last, sitting up <b>and</b> straightening his back, as if he had made a decision. “I can’t keep <b>it</b> dark any longer. I have got something <b>to</b> tell you all. But I don’t know quite how <b>to</b> begin.”
<br>   “I think I could help you,” said Merry quietly, “<b>by</b> telling you some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> myself.”
<br>   “What do you mean?” said Frodo, looking at him anxiously. “Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don’t know how <b>to</b> say good-bye. You meant <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire, <b>of</b> course. But danger has come <b>on</b> you sooner than you expected, <b>and</b> now you are making up your mind <b>to</b> go at once. And you don’t want <b>to</b>. We are very sorry for you.”
<br>   Frodo opened his mouth <b>and</b> shut <b>it</b> again. His look <b>of</b> surprise was so comical that they laughed. “Dear old Frodo!” said Pippin. “Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful <b>or</b> clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning <b>to</b> go <b>and</b> saying farewell <b>to</b> all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly heard you muttering: “Shall I ever look down <b>into</b> that valley again, I wonder”, <b>and</b> things like that. And pretending that you had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your money, <b>and</b> actually selling your beloved Bag End <b>to</b> those Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.”
<br>   “Good heavens!” said Frodo. “I thought I had been both careful <b>and</b> clever. I don’t know what Gandalf would say. Is all <b>the</b> Shire discussing my departure then?”
<br>   “Oh <b>no</b>!” said Merry. “Don’t worry about that! The secret won’t keep for long, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> at present <b>it</b> is, I think, only known <b>to</b> us conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, <b>and</b> are often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, too. To tell you <b>the</b> truth, I had been watching you rather closely ever since he left. I thought you would go after him sooner <b>or</b> later; indeed I expected you <b>to</b> go sooner, <b>and</b> lately we have been very anxious. We have been terrified that you might give us <b>the</b> slip, <b>and</b> go off suddenly, all <b>on</b> your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, <b>and</b> done a good deal <b>of</b> planning <b>on</b> our own account. You are not going <b>to</b> escape so easily!”
<br>   “But I must go,” said Frodo. “It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is wretched for us all, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is <b>no</b> use your trying <b>to</b> keep me. Since you have guessed so much, please help me <b>and</b> do not hinder me!”
<br>   “You do not understand!” said Pippin. “You must go—<b>and</b> therefore we must, too. Merry <b>and</b> I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow, <b>and</b> would jump down a dragon’s throat <b>to</b> save you, if he did not trip over his own feet; <b>but</b> you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure.”
<br>   “My dear <b>and</b> most beloved hobbits!” said Frodo deeply moved. “But I could not allow <b>it</b>. I decided that long ago, too. You speak <b>of</b> danger, <b>but</b> you do not understand. This is <b>no</b> treasure-hunt, <b>no</b> there-<b>and</b>-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril <b>into</b> deadly peril.”
<br>   “Of course we understand,” said Merry firmly. “That is why we have decided <b>to</b> come. We know <b>the</b> Ring is <b>no</b> laughing-matter; <b>but</b> we are going <b>to</b> do our best <b>to</b> help you against <b>the</b> Enemy.”
<br>   “The Ring!” said Frodo, now completely amazed.
<br>   “Yes, <b>the</b> Ring,” said Merry. “My dear old hobbit, you don’t allow for <b>the</b> inquisitiveness <b>of</b> friends. I have known about <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring for years—before Bilbo went away, in fact; <b>but</b> since he obviously regarded <b>it</b> as secret, I kept <b>the</b> knowledge in my head, until we formed our conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, <b>of</b> course, as well as I know you; I was too young, <b>and</b> he was also more careful—<b>but</b> he was not careful enough. If you want <b>to</b> know how I first found out, I will tell you.”
<br>   “Go <b>on</b>!” said Frodo faintly.
<br>   “It was <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might expect. One day, a year before <b>the</b> Party, I happened <b>to</b> be walking along <b>the</b> road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in <b>the</b> distance <b>the</b> S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, <b>and</b> then hey presto! he vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had <b>the</b> wits <b>to</b> hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; <b>but</b> I got through <b>the</b> hedge <b>and</b> walked along <b>the</b> field inside. I was peeping through <b>into</b> <b>the</b> road, after <b>the</b> S.-B.s had passed, <b>and</b> was looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint <b>of</b> gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.
<br>   “After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But you must admit that <b>it</b> was very intriguing, <b>and</b> I was only in my teens. I must be <b>the</b> only one in <b>the</b> Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen <b>the</b> old fellow’s secret book.”
<br>   “You have read his book!” cried Frodo. “Good heavens above! Is nothing safe?”
<br>   “Not too safe, I should say,” said Merry. “But I have only had one rapid glance, <b>and</b> that was difficult <b>to</b> get. He never left <b>the</b> book about. I wonder what became <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. I should like another look. Have you got <b>it</b>, Frodo?”
<br>   “No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken <b>it</b> away.”
<br>   “Well, as I was saying,” Merry proceeded, “I kept my knowledge <b>to</b> myself, till this Spring when things got serious. Then we formed our conspiracy; <b>and</b> as we were serious, too, <b>and</b> meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut <b>to</b> crack, <b>and</b> Gandalf is worse. But if you want <b>to</b> be introduced <b>to</b> our chief investigator, I can produce him.”
<br>   “Where is he?” said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked <b>and</b> sinister figure <b>to</b> come out <b>of</b> a cupboard.
<br>   “Step forward, Sam!” said Merry; <b>and</b> Sam stood up with a face scarlet up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ears. “Here’s our collector <b>of</b> information! And he collected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say, he seemed <b>to</b> regard himself as <b>on</b> parole, <b>and</b> dried up.”
<br>   “Sam!” cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go <b>no</b> further, <b>and</b> quite unable <b>to</b> decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, <b>or</b> merely foolish.
<br>   “Yes, sir!” said Sam. “Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant <b>no</b> wrong <b>to</b> you, Mr. Frodo, nor <b>to</b> Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He has some sense, mind you; <b>and</b> when you said go alone, he said <b>no</b>! take someone as you can trust.”
<br>   “But <b>it</b> does not seem that I can trust anyone,” said Frodo. Sam looked at him unhappily. “It all depends <b>on</b> what you want,” put in Merry. “You can trust us <b>to</b> stick <b>to</b> you through thick <b>and</b> thin—<b>to</b> <b>the</b> bitter end. And you can trust us <b>to</b> keep any secret <b>of</b> yours—closer than you keep <b>it</b> yourself. But you cannot trust us <b>to</b> let you face trouble alone, <b>and</b> go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there <b>it</b> is. We know most <b>of</b> what Gandalf has told you. We know a good deal about <b>the</b> Ring. We are horribly afraid—<b>but</b> we are coming with you; <b>or</b> following you like hounds.”
<br>   “And after all, sir,” added Sam, “you did ought <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> Elves” advice. Gildor said you should take them as was willing, <b>and</b> you can’t deny <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “I don’t deny <b>it</b>,” said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. “I don’t deny <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> I’ll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you snore <b>or</b> not. I shall kick you hard <b>to</b> make sure.
<br>   “You are a set <b>of</b> deceitful scoundrels!” he said, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “But bless you!” he laughed, getting up <b>and</b> waving his arms, “I give in. I will take Gildor’s advice. If <b>the</b> danger were not so dark, I should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.”
<br>   “Good! That’s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo <b>and</b> company!” they shouted; <b>and</b> they danced round him. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin began a song, which they had apparently got ready for <b>the</b> occasion.
<br>   It was made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dwarf-song that started Bilbo <b>on</b> his adventure long ago, <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same tune:
<br>   
<br>Farewell we call <b>to</b> hearth <b>and</b> hall!
<br>Though wind may blow <b>and</b> rain may fall,
<br>We must away ere break <b>of</b> day
<br>Far over wood <b>and</b> mountain tall.
<br>
<br>To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell
<br>In glades beneath <b>the</b> misty fell,
<br>Through moor <b>and</b> waste we ride in haste,
<br>And whither then we cannot tell.
<br>
<br>With foes ahead, behind us dread,
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> sky shall be our bed,
<br>Until at last our toil be passed,
<br>Our journey done, our errand sped.
<br>
<br>We must away! We must away!
<br>We ride before <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> day!
<br>   
<br>   “Very good!” said Frodo. “But in that case there are a lot <b>of</b> things <b>to</b> do before we go <b>to</b> bed—under a roof, for tonight at any rate.”
<br>   “Oh! That was poetry!” said Pippin. “Do you really mean <b>to</b> start before <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> day?”
<br>   “I don’t know,” answered Frodo. “I fear those Black Riders, <b>and</b> I am sure <b>it</b> is unsafe <b>to</b> stay in one place long, especially in a place <b>to</b> which <b>it</b> is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not <b>to</b> wait. But I should very much like <b>to</b> see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends <b>on</b> two things. How soon could <b>the</b> Riders get <b>to</b> Bucklebury? And how soon could we get off? It will take a good deal <b>of</b> preparation.”
<br>   “The answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second question,” said Merry, “is that we could get off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies in a stable across <b>the</b> fields; stores <b>and</b> tackle are all packed, except for a few extra clothes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perishable food.”
<br>   “It seems <b>to</b> have been a very efficient conspiracy,” said Frodo. “But what about <b>the</b> Black Riders? Would <b>it</b> be safe <b>to</b> wait one day for Gandalf?”
<br>   “That all depends <b>on</b> what you think <b>the</b> Riders would do, if they found you here,” answered Merry. “They could have reached here <b>by</b> now, <b>of</b> course, if they were not stopped at <b>the</b> North-gate, where <b>the</b> Hedge runs down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river-bank, just this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them through <b>by</b> night, though they might break through. Even in <b>the</b> daylight they would try <b>to</b> keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hall—for they would not like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders, <b>and</b> would certainly be frightened <b>by</b> them. But, <b>of</b> course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long. And <b>it</b> is possible that in <b>the</b> morning even a Black Rider that rode up <b>and</b> asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back <b>to</b> live at Crickhollow.”
<br>   Frodo sat for a while in thought. “I have made up my mind,” he said finally. “I am starting tomorrow, as soon as <b>it</b> is light. But I am not going <b>by</b> road: <b>it</b> would be safer <b>to</b> wait here than that. If I go through <b>the</b> North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead <b>of</b> being secret for several days at least, as <b>it</b> might be. And what is more, <b>the</b> Bridge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> East Road near <b>the</b> borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets <b>into</b> Buckland <b>or</b> not. We don’t know how many there are; <b>but</b> there are at least two, <b>and</b> possibly more. The only thing <b>to</b> do is <b>to</b> go off in a quite unexpected direction.”
<br>   “But that can only mean going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest!” said Fredegar horrified. “You can’t be thinking <b>of</b> doing that. It is quite as dangerous as Black Riders.”
<br>   “Not quite,” said Merry. It sounds very desperate, <b>but</b> I believe Frodo is right. It is <b>the</b> only way <b>of</b> getting off without being followed at once. With luck we might gel a considerable start.”
<br>   “But you won’t have any luck in <b>the</b> Old Forest,” objected Fredegar. “No one ever has luck in there. You’ll gel lost. People don’t go in there.”
<br>   “Oh yes they do!” said Merry. “The Brandybucks go in—occasionally when <b>the</b> fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, <b>of</b> course, when <b>the</b> trees are sleepy <b>and</b> fairly quiet.”
<br>   “Well, do as you think best!” said Fredegar. “I am more afraid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest than <b>of</b> anything I know about: <b>the</b> stories about <b>it</b> are a nightmare; <b>but</b> my vote hardly counts, as I am not going <b>on</b> <b>the</b> journey. Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.”
<br>   Fond as he was <b>of</b> Frodo, Fatty Bolger had <b>no</b> desire <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire, nor <b>to</b> see what lay outside <b>it</b>. His family came from <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, <b>but</b> he had never been over <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge. His task, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original plans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspirators, was <b>to</b> stay behind <b>and</b> deal with inquisitive folk, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> keep up as long as possible <b>the</b> pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some old clothes <b>of</b> Frodo’s <b>to</b> help him in playing <b>the</b> part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove.
<br>   “Excellent!” said Frodo, when he understood <b>the</b> plan. “We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don’t know whether these Riders can read <b>or</b> not, <b>of</b> course, <b>but</b> I should not have dared <b>to</b> risk a written message, in case they got in <b>and</b> searched <b>the</b> house. But if Fatty is willing <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> fort, <b>and</b> I can be sure <b>of</b> Gandalf knowing <b>the</b> way we have gone, that decides me. I am going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest first thing tomorrow.”
<br>   “Well, that’s that,” said Pippin. “On <b>the</b> whole I would rather have our job than Fatty’s—waiting here till Black Riders come.”
<br>   “You wait till you are well inside <b>the</b> Forest,” said Fredegar. “You’ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.”
<br>   “It’s <b>no</b> good arguing about <b>it</b> any more,” said Merry. “We have still got <b>to</b> tidy up <b>and</b> put <b>the</b> finishing touches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> packing, before we get <b>to</b> bed. I shall call you all before <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> day.”
<br>   When at last he had got <b>to</b> bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. His legs ached. He. was glad that he was riding in <b>the</b> morning. Eventually he fell <b>into</b> a vague dream, in which he seemed <b>to</b> be looking out <b>of</b> a high window over a dark sea <b>of</b> tangled trees. Down below among <b>the</b> roots there was <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> creatures crawling <b>and</b> snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner <b>or</b> later.
<br>   Then he heard a noise in <b>the</b> distance. At first he thought <b>it</b> was a great wind coming over <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest. Then he knew that <b>it</b> was not leaves, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in waking life, though <b>it</b> had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he was out in <b>the</b> open. There were <b>no</b> trees after all. He was <b>on</b> a dark heath, <b>and</b> there was a strange salt smell in <b>the</b> air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone <b>on</b> a high ridge. A great desire came over him <b>to</b> climb <b>the</b> tower <b>and</b> see <b>the</b> Sea. He started <b>to</b> struggle up <b>the</b> ridge towards <b>the</b> tower: <b>but</b> suddenly a light came in <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> there was a noise <b>of</b> thunder.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>THE OLD FOREST
<br>
<br>   Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in <b>the</b> room. Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand, <b>and</b> banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door with <b>the</b> other. “All right! What is <b>it</b>?” said Frodo, still shaken <b>and</b> bewildered.
<br>   “What is <b>it</b>!” cried Merry. “It is time <b>to</b> get up. It is half past four <b>and</b> very foggy. Come <b>on</b>! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin is up. I am just going <b>to</b> saddle <b>the</b> ponies, <b>and</b> fetch <b>the</b> one that is <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up <b>and</b> see us off.”
<br>   Soon after six o’clock <b>the</b> five hobbits were ready <b>to</b> start. Fatty Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Merry went in front leading a laden pony, <b>and</b> took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> then cut across several fields. The leaves <b>of</b> trees were glistening, <b>and</b> every twig was dripping; <b>the</b> grass was grey with cold dew. Everything was still, <b>and</b> far-away noises seemed near <b>and</b> clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door <b>of</b> a distant house.
<br>   In their shed they found <b>the</b> ponies; sturdy little beasts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind loved <b>by</b> hobbits, not speedy, <b>but</b> good for a long day’s work. They mounted, <b>and</b> soon they were riding off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist, which seemed <b>to</b> open reluctantly before them <b>and</b> close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for about an hour, slowly <b>and</b> without talking, they saw <b>the</b> Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It was tall <b>and</b> netted over with silver cobwebs. “How are you going <b>to</b> get through this?” asked Fredegar. “Follow me!” said Merry, “<b>and</b> you will see.” He turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left along <b>the</b> Hedge, <b>and</b> soon they came <b>to</b> a point where <b>it</b> bent inwards, running along <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> a hollow. A cutting had been made, at some distance from <b>the</b> Hedge, <b>and</b> went sloping gently down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. It had walls <b>of</b> brick at <b>the</b> sides, which rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over <b>and</b> formed a tunnel that dived deep under <b>the</b> Hedge <b>and</b> came out in <b>the</b> hollow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side.
<br>   Here Fatty Bolger halted. “Good-bye, Frodo!” he said. “I wish you were not going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before <b>the</b> day is out. But good luck <b>to</b> you—today <b>and</b> every day!”
<br>   “If there are <b>no</b> worse things ahead than <b>the</b> Old Forest, I shall be lucky,” said Frodo. “Tell Gandalf <b>to</b> hurry along <b>the</b> East Road: we shall soon be back <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> going as fast as we can.” “Good-bye!” they cried, <b>and</b> rode down <b>the</b> slope <b>and</b> disappeared from Fredegar’s sight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tunnel.
<br>   It was dark <b>and</b> damp. At <b>the</b> far end <b>it</b> was closed <b>by</b> a gate <b>of</b> thick-set iron bars. Merry got down <b>and</b> unlocked <b>the</b> gate, <b>and</b> when they had all passed through he pushed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> again. It shut with a clang, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lock clicked. The sound was ominous.
<br>   “There!” said Merry. “You have left <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> are now outside, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest.”
<br>   “Are <b>the</b> stories about <b>it</b> true?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “I don’t know what stories you mean,” Merry answered. “If you mean <b>the</b> old bogey-stories Fatty’s nurses used <b>to</b> tell him, about goblins <b>and</b> wolves <b>and</b> things <b>of</b> that sort, I should say <b>no</b>. At any rate I don’t believe them. But <b>the</b> Forest is queer. Everything in <b>it</b> is very much more alive, more aware <b>of</b> what is going <b>on</b>, so <b>to</b> speak, than things are in <b>the</b> Shire. And <b>the</b> trees do not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content merely <b>to</b> watch you, as long as daylight lasts, <b>and</b> don’t do much. Occasionally <b>the</b> most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, <b>or</b> stick a root out, <b>or</b> grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, <b>or</b> so I am told. I have only once <b>or</b> twice been in here after dark, <b>and</b> then only near <b>the</b> hedge. I thought all <b>the</b> trees were whispering <b>to</b> each other, passing news <b>and</b> plots along in an unintelligible language; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> branches swayed <b>and</b> groped without any wind. They do say <b>the</b> trees do actually move, <b>and</b> can surround strangers <b>and</b> hem them in. In fact long ago they attacked <b>the</b> Hedge: they came <b>and</b> planted themselves right <b>by</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> leaned over <b>it</b>. But <b>the</b> hobbits came <b>and</b> cut down hundreds <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> made a great bonfire in <b>the</b> Forest, <b>and</b> burned all <b>the</b> ground in a long strip east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hedge. After that <b>the</b> trees gave up <b>the</b> attack, <b>but</b> they became very unfriendly. There is still a wide bare space not far inside where <b>the</b> bonfire was made.”
<br>   “Is <b>it</b> only <b>the</b> trees that are dangerous?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “There are various queer things living deep in <b>the</b> Forest, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side,” said Merry, “<b>or</b> at least I have heard so; <b>but</b> I have never seen any <b>of</b> them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; <b>but</b> they seem <b>to</b> shift <b>and</b> change from time <b>to</b> time in a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, <b>or</b> was for a long time, <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> quite a broad path leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bonfire Glade, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> more <b>or</b> less in our direction, east <b>and</b> a little north. That is <b>the</b> path I am going <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> find.”
<br>   The hobbits now left <b>the</b> tunnel-gate <b>and</b> rode across <b>the</b> wide hollow. On <b>the</b> far side was a faint path leading up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, a hundred yards <b>and</b> more beyond <b>the</b> Hedge; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> vanished as soon as <b>it</b> brought them under <b>the</b> trees. Looking back they could see <b>the</b> dark line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hedge through <b>the</b> stems <b>of</b> trees that were already thick about them. Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks <b>of</b> innumerable sizes <b>and</b> shapes: straight <b>or</b> bent, twisted, leaning, squat <b>or</b> slender, smooth <b>or</b> gnarled <b>and</b> branched; <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> stems were green <b>or</b> grey with moss <b>and</b> slimy, shaggy growths.
<br>   Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. “You had better lead <b>on</b> <b>and</b> find that path,” Frodo said <b>to</b> him. “Don’t let us lose one another, <b>or</b> forget which way <b>the</b> Hedge lies!”
<br>   They picked a way among <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding <b>the</b> many writhing <b>and</b> interlacing roots. There was <b>no</b> undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, <b>and</b> as they went forward <b>it</b> seemed that <b>the</b> trees became taller, darker, <b>and</b> thicker. There was <b>no</b> sound, except an occasional drip <b>of</b> moisture falling through <b>the</b> still leaves. For <b>the</b> moment there was <b>no</b> whispering <b>or</b> movement among <b>the</b> branches; <b>but</b> they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepening <b>to</b> dislike <b>and</b> even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, <b>or</b> glancing back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.
<br>   There was not as yet any sign <b>of</b> a path, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees seemed constantly <b>to</b> bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear <b>it</b> any longer, <b>and</b> without warning let out a shout. “Oi! Oi!” he cried. “I am not going <b>to</b> do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!”
<br>   The others halted startled; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> cry fell as if muffled <b>by</b> a heavy curtain. There was <b>no</b> echo <b>or</b> answer though <b>the</b> wood seemed <b>to</b> become more crowded <b>and</b> more watchful than before.
<br>   “I should not shout, if I were you,” said Merry. It does more harm than good.”
<br>   Frodo began <b>to</b> wonder if <b>it</b> were possible <b>to</b> find a way through, <b>and</b> if he had been right <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> others come <b>into</b> this abominable wood. Merry was looking from side <b>to</b> side, <b>and</b> seemed already uncertain which way <b>to</b> go. Pippin noticed <b>it</b>. “It has not taken you long <b>to</b> lose us,” he said. But at that moment Merry gave a whistle <b>of</b> relief <b>and</b> pointed ahead.
<br>   “Well, well!” he said. “These trees do shift. There is <b>the</b> Bonfire Glade in front <b>of</b> us (<b>or</b> I hope so), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> path <b>to</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> have moved away!”
<br>   The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above them, blue <b>and</b> clear <b>to</b> their surprise, for down under <b>the</b> Forest-roof they had not been able <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> rising morning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lifting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mist. The sun was not, however, high enough yet <b>to</b> shine down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clearing, though its light was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker <b>and</b> greener about <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glade, enclosing <b>it</b> with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass <b>and</b> many tall plants: stalky <b>and</b> faded hemlocks <b>and</b> wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding <b>into</b> fluffy ashes, <b>and</b> rampant nettles <b>and</b> thistles. A dreary place: <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed a charming <b>and</b> cheerful garden after <b>the</b> close Forest.
<br>   The hobbits felt encouraged, <b>and</b> looked up hopefully at <b>the</b> broadening daylight in <b>the</b> sky. At <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glade there was a break in <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> a clear path beyond <b>it</b>. They could see <b>it</b> running <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood, wide in places <b>and</b> open above, though every now <b>and</b> again <b>the</b> trees drew in <b>and</b> overshadowed <b>it</b> with their dark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were still climbing gently, <b>but</b> they now went much quicker, <b>and</b> with better heart; for <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> them that <b>the</b> Forest had relented, <b>and</b> was going <b>to</b> let them pass unhindered after all.
<br>   But after a while <b>the</b> air began <b>to</b> get hot <b>and</b> stuffy. The trees drew close again <b>on</b> either side, <b>and</b> they could <b>no</b> longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again <b>the</b> ill will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood pressing <b>on</b> them. So silent was <b>it</b> that <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> their ponies” hoofs, rustling <b>on</b> dead leaves <b>and</b> occasionally stumbling <b>on</b> hidden roots, seemed <b>to</b> thud in their ears. Frodo tried <b>to</b> sing a song <b>to</b> encourage them, <b>but</b> his voice sank <b>to</b> a murmur.
<br>   
<br>O! Wanderers in <b>the</b> shadowed land
<br>despair not! For though dark they stand,
<br>all woods there be must end at last,
<br><b>and</b> see <b>the</b> open sun go past:
<br><b>the</b> setting sun, <b>the</b> rising sun,
<br><b>the</b> day’s end, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> day begun.
<br>For east <b>or</b> west all woods must fail…
<br>   
<br>   Fail—even as he said <b>the</b> word his voice faded <b>into</b> silence. The air seemed heavy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> making <b>of</b> words wearisome. Just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash <b>into</b> <b>the</b> path. The trees seemed <b>to</b> close in before them.
<br>   “They do not like all that about ending <b>and</b> failing,” said Merry. “I should not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge, <b>and</b> then we’ll turn <b>and</b> give them a rousing chorus!”
<br>   He spoke cheerfully, <b>and</b> if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show <b>it</b>. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy weight was settling steadily <b>on</b> Frodo’s heart, <b>and</b> he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought <b>of</b> challenging <b>the</b> menace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. He was, indeed, just about <b>to</b> stop <b>and</b> propose going back (if that was still possible), when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, <b>and</b> became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, <b>and</b> ahead they could see <b>the</b> path going almost straight forward. Before them, <b>but</b> some distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encircling wood. The path seemed <b>to</b> be making directly for <b>it</b>.
<br>   They now hurried forward again, delighted with <b>the</b> thought <b>of</b> climbing out for a while above <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest. The path dipped, <b>and</b> then again began <b>to</b> climb upwards, leading them at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steep hillside. There <b>it</b> left <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turf. The wood stood all round <b>the</b> hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown.
<br>   The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round <b>and</b> round until they reached <b>the</b> top. There they stood <b>and</b> gazed about them. The air was gleaming <b>and</b> sunlit, <b>but</b> hazy; <b>and</b> they could not see <b>to</b> any great distance. Near at hand <b>the</b> mist was now almost gone; though here <b>and</b> there <b>it</b> lay in hollows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> them, out <b>of</b> a deep fold cutting right across <b>the</b> Forest, <b>the</b> fog still rose like steam <b>or</b> wisps <b>of</b> white smoke.
<br>   “That,” said Merry, pointing with his hand, “that is <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle. It comes down out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs <b>and</b> flows south-west through <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> Brandywine below Haysend. We don’t want <b>to</b> go that way! The Withywindle valley is said <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> queerest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole wood—<b>the</b> centre from which all <b>the</b> queerness comes, as <b>it</b> were.”
<br>   The others looked in <b>the</b> direction that Merry pointed out, <b>but</b> they could see little <b>but</b> mists over <b>the</b> damp <b>and</b> deep-cut valley; <b>and</b> beyond <b>it</b> <b>the</b> southern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest faded from view.
<br>   The sun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top was now getting hot. It must have been about eleven o’clock; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions. In <b>the</b> west they could not make out either <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hedge <b>or</b> <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine beyond <b>it</b>. Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great East Road, for which they were making. They were <b>on</b> an island in a sea <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> horizon was veiled.
<br>   On <b>the</b> south-eastern side <b>the</b> ground fell very steeply, as if <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill were continued far down under <b>the</b> trees, like island-shores that really are <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> a mountain rising out <b>of</b> deep waters. They sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green edge <b>and</b> looked out over <b>the</b> woods below them, while they ate their mid-day meal. As <b>the</b> sun rose <b>and</b> passed noon they glimpsed far off in <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> grey-green lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs that lay beyond <b>the</b> Old Forest <b>on</b> that side. That cheered them greatly; for <b>it</b> was good <b>to</b> see a sight <b>of</b> anything beyond <b>the</b> wood’s borders, though they did not mean <b>to</b> go that way, if they could help <b>it</b>: <b>the</b> Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as <b>the</b> Forest itself.
<br>   At length they made up their minds <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> again. The path that had brought them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill reappeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northward side; <b>but</b> they had not followed <b>it</b> far before they became aware that <b>it</b> was bending steadily <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. Soon <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> descend rapidly <b>and</b> they guessed that <b>it</b> must actually be heading towards <b>the</b> Withywindle valley: not at all <b>the</b> direction they wished lo take. After some discussion they decided <b>to</b> leave this misleading path <b>and</b> strike northward; for although they had not been able <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> from <b>the</b> hill-top, <b>the</b> Road must lie that way, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> could not be many miles off. Also northward, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path, <b>the</b> land seemed lo be drier <b>and</b> more open, climbing up <b>to</b> slopes where <b>the</b> trees were thinner, <b>and</b> pines <b>and</b> firs replaced <b>the</b> oaks <b>and</b> ashes <b>and</b> other strange <b>and</b> nameless trees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> denser wood.
<br>   At first their choice seemed <b>to</b> be good: they got along at a fair speed, though whenever they got a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably <b>to</b> have veered eastwards. But after a time <b>the</b> trees began <b>to</b> close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance <b>to</b> be thinner <b>and</b> less tangled. Then deep folds in <b>the</b> ground were discovered unexpectedly, like <b>the</b> ruts <b>of</b> great giant-wheels <b>or</b> wide moats <b>and</b> sunken roads long disused <b>and</b> choked with brambles. These lay usually right across their line <b>of</b> march, <b>and</b> could only be crossed <b>by</b> scrambling down <b>and</b> out again, which was troublesome <b>and</b> difficult with their ponies. Each time they climbed down they found <b>the</b> hollow filled with thick bushes <b>and</b> matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, <b>but</b> only gave way when they turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right; <b>and</b> they had <b>to</b> go some distance along <b>the</b> bottom before they could find a way up <b>the</b> further bank. Each time they clambered out, <b>the</b> trees seemed deeper <b>and</b> darker; <b>and</b> always <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> upwards <b>it</b> was most difficult <b>to</b> find a way, <b>and</b> they were forced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right <b>and</b> downwards.
<br>   After an hour <b>or</b> two they had lost all clear sense <b>of</b> direction, though they knew well enough that they had long ceased <b>to</b> go northward at all. They were being headed off, <b>and</b> were simply following a course chosen for them—eastwards <b>and</b> southwards, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>and</b> not out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>   The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled <b>and</b> stumbled <b>into</b> a fold that was wider <b>and</b> deeper than any they had yet met. It was so sleep <b>and</b> overhung that <b>it</b> proved impossible <b>to</b> climb out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again, either forwards <b>or</b> backwards, without leaving their ponies <b>and</b> their baggage behind. All they could do was <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> fold—downwards. The ground grew soft, <b>and</b> in places boggy; springs appeared in <b>the</b> banks, <b>and</b> soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled <b>and</b> babbled through a weedy bed. Then <b>the</b> ground began <b>to</b> fall rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> brook growing strong <b>and</b> noisy, flowed <b>and</b> leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully over-arched <b>by</b> trees high above them.
<br>   After stumbling along for some way along <b>the</b> stream, they came quite suddenly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gloom. As if through a gate they saw <b>the</b> sunlight before them. Coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide space <b>of</b> grass <b>and</b> reeds; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep. A golden afternoon <b>of</b> late sunshine lay warm <b>and</b> drowsy upon <b>the</b> hidden land between. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>it</b> there wound lazily a dark river <b>of</b> brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows, blocked with fallen willows, <b>and</b> flecked with thousands <b>of</b> faded willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from <b>the</b> branches; for there was a warm <b>and</b> gentle breeze blowing softly in <b>the</b> valley, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reeds were rustling, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> willow-boughs were creaking.
<br>   “Well, now I have at least some notion <b>of</b> where we are!” said Merry. “We have come almost in <b>the</b> opposite direction <b>to</b> which we intended. This is <b>the</b> River Withywindle! I will go <b>on</b> <b>and</b> explore.”
<br>   He passed out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sunshine <b>and</b> disappeared <b>into</b> <b>the</b> long grasses. After a while he reappeared, <b>and</b> reported that there was fairly solid ground between <b>the</b> cliff-foot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> river; in some places firm turf went down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water’s edge. “What’s more,” he said, “there seems <b>to</b> be something like a footpath winding along <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. If we turn left <b>and</b> follow <b>it</b>, we shall be bound <b>to</b> come out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest eventually.”
<br>   “I dare say!” said Pippin. “That is, if <b>the</b> track goes <b>on</b> so far, <b>and</b> does not simply lead us <b>into</b> a bog <b>and</b> leave us there. Who made <b>the</b> track, do you suppose, <b>and</b> why? I am sure <b>it</b> was not for our benefit. I am getting very suspicious <b>of</b> this Forest <b>and</b> everything in <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> I begin <b>to</b> believe all <b>the</b> stories about <b>it</b>. And have you any idea how far eastward we should have <b>to</b> go?”
<br>   “No,” said Merry, “I haven’t. I don’t know in <b>the</b> least how far down <b>the</b> Withywindle we are, <b>or</b> who could possibly come here often enough <b>to</b> make a path along <b>it</b>. But there is <b>no</b> other way out that I can see <b>or</b> think <b>of</b>.”
<br>   There being nothing else for <b>it</b>, they filed out, <b>and</b> Merry led them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> path that he had discovered. Everywhere <b>the</b> reeds <b>and</b> grasses were lush <b>and</b> tall, in places far above their heads; <b>but</b> once found, <b>the</b> path was easy <b>to</b> follow, as <b>it</b> turned <b>and</b> twisted, picking out <b>the</b> sounder ground among <b>the</b> bogs <b>and</b> pools. Here <b>and</b> there <b>it</b> passed over other rills, running down gullies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher forest-lands, <b>and</b> at these points there were tree-trunks <b>or</b> bundles <b>of</b> brushwood laid carefully across.
<br>   The hobbits began <b>to</b> feel very hot. There were armies <b>of</b> flies <b>of</b> all kinds buzzing round their ears, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> afternoon sun was burning <b>on</b> their backs. At last they came suddenly <b>into</b> a thin shade; great grey branches reached across <b>the</b> path. Each step forward became more reluctant than <b>the</b> last. Sleepiness seemed <b>to</b> be creeping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>and</b> up their legs, <b>and</b> falling softly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air upon their heads <b>and</b> eyes.
<br>   Frodo felt his chin go down <b>and</b> his head nod. Just in front <b>of</b> him Pippin fell forward <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his knees. Frodo halted. “It’s <b>no</b> good,” he heard Merry saying. “Can’t go another step without rest. Must have nap. It’s cool under <b>the</b> willows. Less flies!”
<br>   Frodo did not like <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> this. “Come <b>on</b>!” he cried. “We can’t have a nap yet. We must get clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest first.” But <b>the</b> others were too far gone <b>to</b> care. Beside them Sam stood yawning <b>and</b> blinking stupidly.
<br>   Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. There now seemed hardly a sound in <b>the</b> air. The flies had stopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> hearing, a soft fluttering as <b>of</b> a song half whispered, seemed <b>to</b> stir in <b>the</b> boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes <b>and</b> saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old <b>and</b> hoary. Enormous <b>it</b> looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long-fingered hands, its knotted <b>and</b> twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as <b>the</b> boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against <b>the</b> bright sky dazzled him, <b>and</b> he toppled over, lying where he fell upon <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   Merry <b>and</b> Pippin dragged themselves forward <b>and</b> lay down with their backs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> willow-trunk. Behind them <b>the</b> great cracks gaped wide <b>to</b> receive them as <b>the</b> tree swayed <b>and</b> creaked. They looked up at <b>the</b> grey <b>and</b> yellow leaves, moving softly against <b>the</b> light, <b>and</b> singing. They shut their eyes, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, saying something about water <b>and</b> sleep. They gave themselves up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spell <b>and</b> fell fast asleep at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great grey willow.
<br>   Frodo lay for a while fighting with <b>the</b> sleep that was overpowering him; then with an effort he struggled <b>to</b> his feel again. He felt a compelling desire for cool water. “Wait for me, Sam,” he stammered. “Must bathe feet a minute.”
<br>   Half in a dream he wandered forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riverward side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, where great winding roots grew out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream, like gnarled dragonets straining down <b>to</b> drink. He straddled one <b>of</b> these, <b>and</b> paddled his hot feel in <b>the</b> cool brown water; <b>and</b> there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against <b>the</b> tree.
<br>   Sam sat down <b>and</b> scratched his head, <b>and</b> yawned like a cavern. He was worried. The afternoon was getting late, <b>and</b> he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny. “There’s more behind this than sun <b>and</b> warm air,” he muttered <b>to</b> himself. “I don’t like this great big tree. I don’t trust <b>it</b>. Hark at <b>it</b> singing about sleep now! This won’t do at all!”
<br>   He pulled himself <b>to</b> his feet, <b>and</b> staggered off <b>to</b> see what had become <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ponies. He found that two had wandered <b>on</b> a good way along <b>the</b> path; <b>and</b> he had just caught them <b>and</b> brought them back towards <b>the</b> others, when he heard two noises; one loud, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other soft <b>but</b> very clear. One was <b>the</b> splash <b>of</b> something heavy falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water; <b>the</b> other was a noise like <b>the</b> snick <b>of</b> a lock when a door quietly closes fast.
<br>   He rushed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank. Frodo was in <b>the</b> water close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge, <b>and</b> a great tree-root seemed <b>to</b> be over him <b>and</b> holding him down, <b>but</b> he was not struggling. Sam gripped him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> jacket, <b>and</b> dragged him from under <b>the</b> root; <b>and</b> then with difficulty hauled him <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank. Almost at once he woke, <b>and</b> coughed <b>and</b> spluttered.
<br>   “Do you know, Sam,” he said at length, “<b>the</b> beastly tree threw me in! I felt <b>it</b>. The big root just twisted round <b>and</b> tipped me in!”
<br>   “You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,” said Sam. “You shouldn’t sit in such a place, if you feel sleepy.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> others?” Frodo asked. “I wonder what sort <b>of</b> dreams they are having.”
<br>   They went round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, <b>and</b> then Sam understood <b>the</b> click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The crack <b>by</b> which he had laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> him was inside a dark opening, <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> which gripped like a pair <b>of</b> pincers.
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Sam beat first upon <b>the</b> tree-trunk where Pippin had lain. They then struggled frantically <b>to</b> pull open <b>the</b> jaws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack that held poor Merry. It was quite useless.
<br>   “What a foul thing <b>to</b> happen!” cried Frodo wildly. “Why did we ever come <b>into</b> this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow!” He kicked <b>the</b> tree with all his strength, heedless <b>of</b> his own feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran through <b>the</b> stem <b>and</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> branches; <b>the</b> leaves rustled <b>and</b> whispered, <b>but</b> with a sound now <b>of</b> faint <b>and</b> far-off laughter.
<br>   “I suppose we haven’t got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?” asked Sam.
<br>   “I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,” said Frodo. “That wouldn’t be much use.”
<br>   “Wait a minute!” cried Sam, struck <b>by</b> an idea suggested <b>by</b> firewood. “We might do something with fire!”
<br>   “We might,” said Frodo doubtfully. “We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside.”
<br>   “We might try <b>to</b> hurt <b>or</b> frighten this tree <b>to</b> begin with,” said Sam fiercely. “If <b>it</b> don’t let them go, I’ll have <b>it</b> down, if I have <b>to</b> gnaw <b>it</b>.” He ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ponies <b>and</b> before long came back with two tinder-boxes <b>and</b> a hatchet.
<br>   Quickly they gathered dry grass <b>and</b> leaves, <b>and</b> bits <b>of</b> bark; <b>and</b> made a pile <b>of</b> broken twigs <b>and</b> chopped sticks. These they heaped against <b>the</b> trunk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree from <b>the</b> prisoners. As soon as Sam had struck a spark <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tinder, <b>it</b> kindled <b>the</b> dry grass <b>and</b> a flurry <b>of</b> flame <b>and</b> smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers <b>of</b> fire licked against <b>the</b> dry scored rind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient tree <b>and</b> scorched <b>it</b>. A tremor ran through <b>the</b> whole willow. The leaves seemed <b>to</b> hiss above their heads with a sound <b>of</b> pain <b>and</b> anger. A loud scream came from Merry, <b>and</b> from far inside <b>the</b> tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.
<br>   “Put <b>it</b> out! Put <b>it</b> out!” cried Merry. “He’ll squeeze me in two, if you don’t. He says so!”
<br>   “Who? What?” shouted Frodo, rushing round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree.
<br>   “Put <b>it</b> out! Put <b>it</b> out!” begged Merry. The branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> willow began <b>to</b> sway violently. There was a sound as <b>of</b> a wind rising <b>and</b> spreading outwards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> other trees round about, as though they had dropped a stone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> quiet slumber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river-valley <b>and</b> set up ripples <b>of</b> anger that ran out over <b>the</b> whole Forest. Sam kicked at <b>the</b> little fire <b>and</b> stamped out <b>the</b> sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea <b>of</b> why he did so, <b>or</b> what he hoped for, ran along <b>the</b> path crying help! help! help! It seemed <b>to</b> him that he could hardly hear <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> his own shrill voice: <b>it</b> was blown away from him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> willow-wind <b>and</b> drowned in a clamour <b>of</b> leaves, as soon as <b>the</b> words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lost <b>and</b> witless.
<br>   Suddenly he slopped. There was an answer, <b>or</b> so he thought; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> come from behind him, away down <b>the</b> path further back in <b>the</b> Forest. He turned round <b>and</b> listened, <b>and</b> soon there could be <b>no</b> doubt: someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly <b>and</b> happily, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was singing nonsense:
<br>   
<br>Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!
<br>Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal <b>the</b> willow!
<br>Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!
<br>   
<br>   Half hopeful <b>and</b> half afraid <b>of</b> some new danger, Frodo <b>and</b> Sam now both stood still. Suddenly out <b>of</b> a long string <b>of</b> nonsense-words (<b>or</b> so they seemed) <b>the</b> voice rose up loud <b>and</b> clear <b>and</b> burst <b>into</b> this song:
<br>   
<br>Hey! Come merry dot! derry dol! My darling!
<br>Light goes <b>the</b> weather-wind <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feathered starling.
<br>Down along under Hill, shining in <b>the</b> sunlight,
<br>Waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep for <b>the</b> cold starlight,
<br>There my pretty lady is. River-woman’s daughter,
<br>Slender as <b>the</b> willow-wand, clearer than <b>the</b> water.
<br>Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing
<br>Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?
<br>Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! <b>and</b> merry-o,
<br>Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!
<br>Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!
<br>Tom’s in a hurry now. Evening will follow day.
<br>Tom’s going home again water-lilies bringing.
<br>Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?
<br>   
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently again <b>on</b> stiff branches. There was another burst <b>of</b> song, <b>and</b> then suddenly, hopping <b>and</b> dancing along <b>the</b> path, there appeared above <b>the</b> reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown <b>and</b> a long blue feather stuck in <b>the</b> band. With another hop <b>and</b> a bound there came <b>into</b> view a man, <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> seemed. At any rate he was too large <b>and</b> heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People, though he made noise enough for one, slumping along with great yellow boots <b>on</b> his thick legs, <b>and</b> charging through grass <b>and</b> rushes like a cow going down <b>to</b> drink. He had a blue coat <b>and</b> a long brown beard; his eyes were blue <b>and</b> bright, <b>and</b> his face was red as a ripe apple, <b>but</b> creased <b>into</b> a hundred wrinkles <b>of</b> laughter. In his hands he carried <b>on</b> a large leaf as <b>on</b> a tray a small pile <b>of</b> white water-lilies.
<br>   “Help!” cried Frodo <b>and</b> Sam running towards him with their hands stretched out.
<br>   “Whoa! Whoa! steady there!” cried <b>the</b> old man, holding up one hand, <b>and</b> they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. “Now, my little fellows, where be you a-going <b>to</b>, puffing like a bellows? What’s <b>the</b> matter here then? Do you know who I am? I’m Tom Bombadil. Tell me what’s your trouble! Tom’s in a hurry now. Don’t you crush my lilies!”
<br>   “My friends are caught in <b>the</b> willow-tree,” cried Frodo breathlessly.
<br>   “Master Merry’s being squeezed in a crack!” cried Sam.
<br>   “What?” shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in <b>the</b> air. “Old Man Willow? Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know <b>the</b> tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! I’ll freeze his marrow cold, if he don’t behave himself. I’ll sing his roots off. I’ll sing a wind up <b>and</b> blow leaf <b>and</b> branch away. Old Man Willow!” Setting down his lilies carefully <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, he ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tree. There he saw Merry’s feet still sticking out—<b>the</b> rest had already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>and</b> began singing <b>into</b> <b>it</b> in a low voice. They could not catch <b>the</b> words, <b>but</b> evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began <b>to</b> kick. Tom sprang away, <b>and</b> breaking off a hanging branch smote <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> willow with <b>it</b>. “You let them out again, Old Man Willow!” he said. “What be you a-thinking <b>of</b>? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go <b>to</b> sleep! Bombadil is talking!” He then seized Merry’s feet <b>and</b> drew him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suddenly widening crack.
<br>   There was a tearing creak <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other crack split open, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran through <b>the</b> tree from root <b>to</b> tip, <b>and</b> complete silence fell.
<br>   “Thank you!” said <b>the</b> hobbits, one after <b>the</b> other.
<br>   Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. “Well, my little fellows!” said he, stooping so that he peered <b>into</b> their faces. “You shall come home with me! The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, <b>and</b> white bread <b>and</b> butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around <b>the</b> supper table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!” With that he picked up his lilies, <b>and</b> then with a beckoning wave <b>of</b> his hand went hopping <b>and</b> dancing along <b>the</b> path eastward, still singing loudly <b>and</b> nonsensically.
<br>   Too surprised <b>and</b> too relieved <b>to</b> talk, <b>the</b> hobbits followed after him as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in front <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> his singing got fainter <b>and</b> further away. Suddenly his voice came floating back <b>to</b> them in a loud halloo!
<br>   
<br>Hop along, my little friends, up <b>the</b> Withywindle!
<br>Tom’s going <b>on</b> ahead candles for <b>to</b> kindle.
<br>Down west sinks <b>the</b> Sun: soon you will be groping.
<br>When <b>the</b> night-shadows fall, then <b>the</b> door will open,
<br>Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window-panes light will twinkle yellow.
<br>Fear <b>no</b> alder black! Heed <b>no</b> hoary willow!
<br>Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes <b>on</b> before you.
<br>Hey now! merry dot! We’ll be waiting for you!
<br>   
<br>   After that <b>the</b> hobbits heard <b>no</b> more. Almost at once <b>the</b> sun seemed <b>to</b> sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees behind them. They thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slanting light <b>of</b> evening glittering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine River, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> windows <b>of</b> Bucklebury beginning <b>to</b> gleam with hundreds <b>of</b> lights. Great shadows fell across them; trunks <b>and</b> branches <b>of</b> trees hung dark <b>and</b> threatening over <b>the</b> path. White mists began <b>to</b> rise <b>and</b> curl <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> stray about <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees upon its borders. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose <b>and</b> mingled with <b>the</b> swiftly falling dusk.
<br>   It became difficult <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> they were very tired. Their legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among <b>the</b> bushes <b>and</b> reeds <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> them; <b>and</b> if they looked up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pale sky, they caught sight <b>of</b> queer gnarled <b>and</b> knobbly faces that gloomed dark against <b>the</b> twilight, <b>and</b> leered down at them from <b>the</b> high bank <b>and</b> <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. They began <b>to</b> feel that all this country was unreal, <b>and</b> that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led <b>to</b> <b>no</b> awakening.
<br>   Just as they felt their feet slowing down <b>to</b> a standstill, they noticed that <b>the</b> ground was gently rising. The water began <b>to</b> murmur. In <b>the</b> darkness they caught <b>the</b> white glimmer <b>of</b> foam, where <b>the</b> river flowed over a short fall. Then suddenly <b>the</b> trees came <b>to</b> an end <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mists were left behind. They stepped out from <b>the</b> Forest, <b>and</b> found a wide sweep <b>of</b> grass welling up before them. The river, now small <b>and</b> swift, was leaping merrily down <b>to</b> meet them, glinting here <b>and</b> there in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars, which were already shining in <b>the</b> sky.
<br>   The grass under their feet was smooth <b>and</b> short, as if <b>it</b> had been mown <b>or</b> shaven. The eaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest behind were clipped, <b>and</b> trim as a hedge. The path was now plain before them, well-tended <b>and</b> bordered with stone. It wound up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a grassy knoll, now grey under <b>the</b> pale starry night; <b>and</b> there, still high above them <b>on</b> a further slope, they saw <b>the</b> twinkling lights <b>of</b> a house. Down again <b>the</b> path went, <b>and</b> then up again, up a long smooth hillside <b>of</b> turf, towards <b>the</b> light. Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom Bombadil’s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind <b>it</b> a steep shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land lay grey <b>and</b> bare, <b>and</b> beyond that <b>the</b> dark shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs stalked away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eastern night.
<br>   They all hurried forward, hobbits <b>and</b> ponies. Already half their weariness <b>and</b> all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merry dol! rolled out <b>the</b> song <b>to</b> greet them.
<br>   
<br>Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!
<br>Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond <b>of</b> parties.
<br>Now let <b>the</b> fun begin! Let us sing together!
<br>   
<br>   Then another clear voice, as young <b>and</b> as ancient as Spring, like <b>the</b> song <b>of</b> a glad water flowing down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night from a bright morning in <b>the</b> hills, came falling like silver <b>to</b> meet them:
<br>   
<br>Now let <b>the</b> song begin! Let us sing together
<br>Of sun, stars, moon <b>and</b> mist, rain <b>and</b> cloudy weather,
<br>Light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> budding leaf, dew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> feather,
<br>Wind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open hill, bells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heather,
<br>Reeds <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shady pool, lilies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water:
<br>Old Tom Bombadil <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River-daughter!
<br>   
<br>   And with that song <b>the</b> hobbits stood upon <b>the</b> threshold, <b>and</b> a golden light was all about them.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL
<br>
<br>   The four hobbits stepped over <b>the</b> wide stone threshold, <b>and</b> stood still, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> lamps swinging from <b>the</b> beams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof; <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table <b>of</b> dark polished wood stood many candles, tall <b>and</b> yellow, burning brightly.
<br>   In a chair, at <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room facing <b>the</b> outer door, sat a woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads <b>of</b> dew; <b>and</b> her belt was <b>of</b> gold, shaped like a chain <b>of</b> flag-lilies set with <b>the</b> pale-blue eyes <b>of</b> forget-me-nots. About her feel in wide vessels <b>of</b> green <b>and</b> brown earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed <b>to</b> be enthroned in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> a pool.
<br>   “Enter, good guests!” she said, <b>and</b> as she spoke they knew that <b>it</b> was her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> bow low, feeling strangely surprised <b>and</b> awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door <b>to</b> beg for a drink <b>of</b> water, have been answered <b>by</b> a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. But before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up <b>and</b> over <b>the</b> lily-bowls, <b>and</b> ran laughing towards them; <b>and</b> as she ran her gown rustled softly like <b>the</b> wind in <b>the</b> flowering borders <b>of</b> a river.
<br>   “Come dear folk!” she said, taking Frodo <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand. “Laugh <b>and</b> be merry! I am Goldberry, daughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River.” Then lightly she passed them <b>and</b> closing <b>the</b> door she turned her back <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, with her white arms spread out across <b>it</b>. “Let us shut out <b>the</b> night!” she said. “For you are still afraid, perhaps, <b>of</b> mist <b>and</b> tree-shadows <b>and</b> deep water, <b>and</b> untame things. Fear nothing! For tonight you are under <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> Tom Bombadil.”
<br>   The hobbits looked at her in wonder; <b>and</b> she looked at each <b>of</b> them <b>and</b> smiled. “Fair lady Goldberry!” said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood enchanted <b>by</b> fair elven-voices; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> spell that was now laid upon him was different: less keen <b>and</b> lofty was <b>the</b> delight, <b>but</b> deeper <b>and</b> nearer <b>to</b> mortal heart; marvellous <b>and</b> yet not strange. “Fair lady Goldberry!” he said again. “Now <b>the</b> joy that was hidden in <b>the</b> songs we heard is made plain <b>to</b> me.
<br>   
<br>O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!
<br>O reed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> living pool! Fair River-daughter!
<br>O spring-time <b>and</b> summer-time, <b>and</b> spring again after!
<br>O wind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> waterfall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaves” laughter!”
<br>   
<br>   Suddenly he stopped <b>and</b> stammered, overcome with surprise <b>to</b> hear himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.
<br>   “Welcome!” she said. “I had not heard that folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire were so sweet-tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; <b>the</b> light in your eyes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ring in your voice tells <b>it</b>. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, <b>and</b> wait for <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired beasts.”
<br>   The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry busied herself about <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> their eyes followed her, for <b>the</b> slender grace <b>of</b> her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind <b>the</b> house came <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> singing. Every now <b>and</b> again they caught, among many a derry dol <b>and</b> a merry dol <b>and</b> a ring a ding dillo <b>the</b> repeated words:
<br>   
<br>Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;
<br>Bright blue his jacket is, <b>and</b> his boots are yellow.
<br>   
<br>   “Fair lady!” said Frodo again after a while. “Tell me, if my asking does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?”
<br>   “He is,” said Goldberry, staying her swift movements <b>and</b> smiling.
<br>   Frodo looked at her questioningly. “He is, as you have seen him,” she said in answer <b>to</b> his look. “He is <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> wood, water, <b>and</b> hill.”
<br>   “Then all this strange land belongs <b>to</b> him?”
<br>   “No indeed!” she answered, <b>and</b> her smile faded. “That would indeed be a burden,” she added in a low voice, as if <b>to</b> herself. “The trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grasses <b>and</b> all things growing <b>or</b> living in <b>the</b> land belong each <b>to</b> themselves. Tom Bombadil is <b>the</b> Master. No one has ever caught old Tom walking in <b>the</b> forest, wading in <b>the</b> water, leaping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-tops under light <b>and</b> shadow. He has <b>no</b> fear. Tom Bombadil is master.”
<br>   A door opened <b>and</b> in came Tom Bombadil. He had now <b>no</b> hat <b>and</b> his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, <b>and</b> going <b>to</b> Goldberry, took her hand.
<br>   “Here’s my pretty lady!” he said, bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “Here’s my Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle! Is <b>the</b> table laden? I see yellow cream <b>and</b> honeycomb, <b>and</b> white bread, <b>and</b> butter; milk, cheese, <b>and</b> green herbs <b>and</b> ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for us? Is <b>the</b> supper ready?”
<br>   “It is,” said Goldberry; “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> guests perhaps are not?”
<br>   Tom clapped his hands <b>and</b> cried: “Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, <b>and</b> you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, <b>and</b> Tom will refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, <b>and</b> wash your weary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks <b>and</b> comb out your tangles!”
<br>   He opened <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> they followed him down a short passage <b>and</b> round a sharp turn. They came <b>to</b> a low room with a sloping roof (a penthouse, <b>it</b> seemed, built <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house). Its walls were <b>of</b> clean stone, <b>but</b> they were mostly covered with green hanging mats <b>and</b> yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, <b>and</b> strewn with fresh green rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor along one side. Against <b>the</b> opposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins, <b>and</b> beside <b>it</b> stood brown ewers filled with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside each bed.
<br>   Before long, washed <b>and</b> refreshed, <b>the</b> hobbits were seated at <b>the</b> table, two <b>on</b> each side, while at either end sat Goldberry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Master. It was a long <b>and</b> merry meal. Though <b>the</b> hobbits ate, as only famished hobbits can eat, there was <b>no</b> lack. The drink in their drinking-bowls seemed <b>to</b> be clear cold water, yet <b>it</b> went <b>to</b> their hearts like wine <b>and</b> set free their voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily, as if <b>it</b> was easier <b>and</b> more natural than talking.
<br>   At last Tom <b>and</b> Goldberry rose <b>and</b> cleared <b>the</b> table swiftly. The guests were commanded <b>to</b> sit quiet, <b>and</b> were set in chairs, each with a footstool <b>to</b> his tired feet. There was a fire in <b>the</b> wide hearth before them, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was burning with a sweet smell, as if <b>it</b> were built <b>of</b> apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all <b>the</b> lights in <b>the</b> room were put out, except one lamp <b>and</b> a pair <b>of</b> candles at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came <b>and</b> stood before them, holding a candle; <b>and</b> she wished them each a good night <b>and</b> deep sleep.
<br>   “Have peace now,” she said, “until <b>the</b> morning! Heed <b>no</b> nightly noises! For nothing passes door <b>and</b> window here save moonlight <b>and</b> starlight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind off <b>the</b> hill-top. Good night!” She passed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room with a glimmer <b>and</b> a rustle. The sound <b>of</b> her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in <b>the</b> quiet <b>of</b> night.
<br>   Tom sat <b>on</b> a while beside them in silence, while each <b>of</b> them tried <b>to</b> muster <b>the</b> courage <b>to</b> ask one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many questions he had meant <b>to</b> ask at supper. Sleep gathered <b>on</b> their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:
<br>   “Did you hear me calling, Master, <b>or</b> was <b>it</b> just chance that brought you at that moment?”
<br>   Tom stirred like a man shaken out <b>of</b> a pleasant dream. “Eh, what?” said he. “Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just chance brought me then, if chance you call <b>it</b>. It was <b>no</b> plan <b>of</b> mine, though I was waiting for you. We heard news <b>of</b> you, <b>and</b> learned that you were wandering. We guessed you’d come ere long down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water: all paths lead that way, down <b>to</b> Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s a mighty singer; <b>and</b> <b>it</b>’s hard for little folk <b>to</b> escape his cunning mazes. But Tom had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.” Tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again; <b>but</b> he went <b>on</b> in a soft singing voice:
<br>   
<br>I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,
<br>green leaves <b>and</b> lilies white <b>to</b> please my pretty lady,
<br><b>the</b> last ere <b>the</b> year’s end <b>to</b> keep them from <b>the</b> winter,
<br><b>to</b> flower <b>by</b> her pretty feet tilt <b>the</b> snows are melted.
<br>Each year at summer’s end I go <b>to</b> find them for her,
<br>in a wide pool, deep <b>and</b> clear, far down Withywindle;
<br>there they open first in spring <b>and</b> there they linger latest.
<br>By that pool long ago I found <b>the</b> River-daughter,
<br>fair young Goldberry sitting in <b>the</b> rushes.
<br>Sweet was her singing then, <b>and</b> her heart was beating!
<br>   
<br>   He opened his eyes <b>and</b> looked at them with a sudden glint <b>of</b> blue:
<br>   
<br>And that proved well for you—for now I shall <b>no</b> longer
<br>go down deep again along <b>the</b> forest-water,
<br>not while <b>the</b> year is old. Nor shall I be passing
<br>Old Man Willow’s house this side <b>of</b> spring-time,
<br>not till <b>the</b> merry spring, when <b>the</b> River-daughter
<br>dances down <b>the</b> withy-path <b>to</b> bathe in <b>the</b> water.
<br>   
<br>   He fell silent again; <b>but</b> Frodo could not help asking one more question: <b>the</b> one he most desired <b>to</b> have answered. “Tell us, Master,” he said, “about <b>the</b> Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard <b>of</b> him before.”
<br>   “No, don’t!” said Merry <b>and</b> Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. “Not now! Not until <b>the</b> morning!”
<br>   “That is right!” said <b>the</b> old man. “Now is <b>the</b> time for resting. Some things are ill <b>to</b> hear when <b>the</b> world’s in shadow. Sleep till <b>the</b> morning-light, rest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow! Heed <b>no</b> nightly noise! Fear <b>no</b> grey willow!” And with that he took down <b>the</b> lamp <b>and</b> blew <b>it</b> out, <b>and</b> grasping a candle in either hand he led them out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.
<br>   Their mattresses <b>and</b> pillows were soft as down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blankets were <b>of</b> white wool. They had hardly laid themselves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deep beds <b>and</b> drawn <b>the</b> light covers over them before they were asleep.
<br>   In <b>the</b> dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw <b>the</b> young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall <b>of</b> rock, pierced <b>by</b> a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that he was lifted up, <b>and</b> passing over he saw that <b>the</b> rock-wall was a circle <b>of</b> hills, <b>and</b> that within <b>it</b> was a plain, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plain stood a pinnacle <b>of</b> stone, like a vast tower <b>but</b> not made <b>by</b> hands. On its top stood <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> a man. The moon as <b>it</b> rose seemed <b>to</b> hang for a moment above his head <b>and</b> glistened in his white hair as <b>the</b> wind stirred <b>it</b>. Up from <b>the</b> dark plain below came <b>the</b> crying <b>of</b> fell voices, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> howling <b>of</b> many wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> great wings, passed across <b>the</b> moon. The figure lifted his arms <b>and</b> a light flashed from <b>the</b> staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down <b>and</b> bore him away. The voices wailed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> was borne <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from <b>the</b> East. “Black Riders!” thought Frodo as he wakened, with <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hoofs still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have <b>the</b> courage <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> these stone walls. He lay motionless, still listening; <b>but</b> all was now silent, <b>and</b> at last he turned <b>and</b> fell asleep again <b>or</b> wandered <b>into</b> some other unremembered dream.
<br>   At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; <b>but</b> a change came over his dreams <b>and</b> he turned <b>and</b> groaned. Suddenly he woke, <b>or</b> thought he had waked, <b>and</b> yet still heard in <b>the</b> darkness <b>the</b> sound that had disturbed his dream: tip-tap, squeak: <b>the</b> noise was like branches fretting in <b>the</b> wind, twig-fingers scraping wall <b>and</b> window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if there were willow-trees close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house; <b>and</b> then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, <b>but</b> inside <b>the</b> willow <b>and</b> listening <b>to</b> that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again. He sat up, <b>and</b> felt <b>the</b> soft pillows yield <b>to</b> his hands, <b>and</b> he lay down again relieved. He seemed <b>to</b> hear <b>the</b> echo <b>of</b> words in his ears: “Fear nothing! Have peace until <b>the</b> morning! Heed <b>no</b> nightly noises!” Then he went <b>to</b> sleep again.
<br>   It was <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> water that Merry heard falling <b>into</b> his quiet sleep: water streaming down gently, <b>and</b> then spreading, spreading irresistibly all round <b>the</b> house <b>into</b> a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled under <b>the</b> walls, <b>and</b> was rising slowly <b>but</b> surely. “I shall be drowned!” he thought. It will find its way in, <b>and</b> then I shall drown.” He felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog, <b>and</b> springing up he set his fool <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner <b>of</b> a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was <b>and</b> lay down again. He seemed <b>to</b> hear <b>or</b> remember hearing: “Nothing passes doors <b>or</b> windows save moonlight <b>and</b> starlight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind off <b>the</b> hill-top.” A little breath <b>of</b> sweet air moved <b>the</b> curtain. He breathed deep <b>and</b> fell asleep again.
<br>   As far as he could remember, Sam slept through <b>the</b> night in deep content, if logs are contented.
<br>   They woke up, all four at once, in <b>the</b> morning light. Tom was moving about <b>the</b> room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped his hands, <b>and</b> cried: “Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!” He drew back <b>the</b> yellow curtains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits saw that these had covered <b>the</b> windows, at either end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, one looking east <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other looking west.
<br>   They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern window, <b>and</b> found himself looking <b>into</b> a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected <b>to</b> see turf right up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually his view was screened <b>by</b> a tall line <b>of</b> beans <b>on</b> poles; <b>but</b> above <b>and</b> far beyond them <b>the</b> grey top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill loomed up against <b>the</b> sunrise. It was a pale morning: in <b>the</b> East, behind long clouds like lines <b>of</b> soiled wool stained red at <b>the</b> edges, lay glimmering deeps <b>of</b> yellow. The sky spoke <b>of</b> rain <b>to</b> come; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> light was broadening quickly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> red flowers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beans began <b>to</b> glow against <b>the</b> wet green leaves.
<br>   Pippin looked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western window, down <b>into</b> a pool <b>of</b> mist. The Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking down <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a sloping cloud-roof from above. There was a fold <b>or</b> channel where <b>the</b> mist was broken <b>into</b> many plumes <b>and</b> billows; <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle. The stream ran down <b>the</b> hill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> vanished <b>into</b> <b>the</b> white shadows. Near at hand was a flower-garden <b>and</b> a clipped hedge silver-netted, <b>and</b> beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was <b>no</b> willow-tree <b>to</b> be seen.
<br>   “Good morning, merry friends!” cried Tom, opening <b>the</b> eastern window wide. A cool air flowed in; <b>it</b> had a rainy smell. “Sun won’t show her face much today. I’m thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilltops, since <b>the</b> grey dawn began, nosing wind <b>and</b> weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; <b>but</b> nought wakes hobbit-folk in <b>the</b> early morning. In <b>the</b> night little folk wake up in <b>the</b> darkness, <b>and</b> sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends! Forget <b>the</b> nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties! If you come soon you’ll find breakfast <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. If you come late you’ll get grass <b>and</b> rain-water!”
<br>   Needless <b>to</b> say—not that Tom’s threat sounded very serious—<b>the</b> hobbits came soon, <b>and</b> left <b>the</b> table late <b>and</b> only when <b>it</b> was beginning lo look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard about <b>the</b> house, clattering in <b>the</b> kitchen, <b>and</b> up <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> stairs, <b>and</b> singing here <b>and</b> there outside. The room looked westward over <b>the</b> mist-clouded valley, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> window was open. Water dripped down from <b>the</b> thatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast <b>the</b> clouds had joined <b>into</b> an unbroken roof, <b>and</b> a straight grey rain came softly <b>and</b> steadily down. Behind its deep curtain <b>the</b> Forest was completely veiled.
<br>   As they looked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window there came falling gently as if <b>it</b> was flowing down <b>the</b> rain out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>the</b> clear voice <b>of</b> Goldberry singing up above them. They could hear few words, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed plain <b>to</b> them that <b>the</b> song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers <b>on</b> dry hills, that told <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> a river from <b>the</b> spring in <b>the</b> highlands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea far below. The hobbits listened with delight; <b>and</b> Frodo was glad in his heart, <b>and</b> blessed <b>the</b> kindly weather, because <b>it</b> delayed them from departing. The thought <b>of</b> going had been heavy upon him from <b>the</b> moment he awoke; <b>but</b> he guessed now that they would not go further that day.
<br>   The upper wind settled in <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> deeper <b>and</b> wetter clouds rolled up <b>to</b> spill their laden rain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bare heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs. Nothing could be seen all round <b>the</b> house <b>but</b> falling water. Frodo stood near <b>the</b> open door <b>and</b> watched <b>the</b> white chalky path turn <b>into</b> a little river <b>of</b> milk <b>and</b> go bubbling away down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round <b>the</b> corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, waving his arms as if he was warding off <b>the</b> rain—<b>and</b> indeed when he sprang over <b>the</b> threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots. These he took off <b>and</b> put in <b>the</b> chimney-corner. Then he sat in <b>the</b> largest chair <b>and</b> called <b>the</b> hobbits <b>to</b> gather round him.
<br>   “This is Goldberry’s washing day,” he said, “<b>and</b> her autumn-cleaning. Too wet for hobbit-folk—let them rest while they are able! It’s a good day for long tales, for questions <b>and</b> for answers, so Tom will start <b>the</b> talking.”
<br>   He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if speaking <b>to</b> himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn <b>to</b> song, <b>and</b> he would get out <b>of</b> his chair <b>and</b> dance about. He told them tales <b>of</b> bees <b>and</b> flowers, <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> strange creatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, about <b>the</b> evil things <b>and</b> good things, things friendly <b>and</b> things unfriendly, cruel things <b>and</b> kind things, <b>and</b> secrets hidden under brambles.
<br>   As they listened, they began <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, apart from themselves, indeed <b>to</b> feel themselves as <b>the</b> strangers where all other things were at home. Moving constantly in <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> his talk was Old Man Willow, <b>and</b> Frodo learned now enough <b>to</b> content him, indeed more than enough, for <b>it</b> was not comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare <b>the</b> hearts <b>of</b> trees <b>and</b> their thoughts, which were often dark <b>and</b> strange, <b>and</b> filled with a hatred <b>of</b> things that go free upon <b>the</b> earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers <b>and</b> usurpers. It was not called <b>the</b> Old Forest without reason, for <b>it</b> was indeed ancient, a survivor <b>of</b> vast forgotten woods; <b>and</b> in <b>it</b> there lived yet, ageing <b>no</b> quicker than <b>the</b> hills, <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> trees, remembering times when they were lords. The countless years had filled them with pride <b>and</b> rooted wisdom, <b>and</b> with malice. But none were more dangerous than <b>the</b> Great Willow: his heart was rotten, <b>but</b> his strength was green; <b>and</b> he was cunning, <b>and</b> a master <b>of</b> winds, <b>and</b> his song <b>and</b> thought ran through <b>the</b> woods <b>on</b> both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth <b>and</b> spread like fine root-threads in <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> invisible twig-fingers in <b>the</b> air, till <b>it</b> had under its dominion nearly all <b>the</b> trees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest from <b>the</b> Hedge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Downs.
<br>   Suddenly Tom’s talk left <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> went leaping up <b>the</b> young stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles <b>and</b> worn rocks, <b>and</b> among small flowers in close grass <b>and</b> wet crannies, wandering at last up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Downs. They heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Barrows, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> green mounds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone-rings upon <b>the</b> hills <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> hollows among <b>the</b> hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks. Green walls <b>and</b> white walls rose. There were fortresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heights. Kings <b>of</b> little kingdoms fought together, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young Sun shone like fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red metal <b>of</b> their new <b>and</b> greedy swords. There was victory <b>and</b> defeat; <b>and</b> towers fell, fortresses were burned, <b>and</b> flames went up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky. Gold was piled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> biers <b>of</b> dead kings <b>and</b> queens; <b>and</b> mounds covered them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone doors were shut; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grass grew over all. Sheep walked for a while biting <b>the</b> grass, <b>but</b> soon <b>the</b> hills were empty again. A shadow came out <b>of</b> dark places far away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bones were stirred in <b>the</b> mounds. Barrow-wights walked in <b>the</b> hollow places with a clink <b>of</b> rings <b>on</b> cold fingers, <b>and</b> gold chains in <b>the</b> wind.” Stone rings grinned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground like broken teeth in <b>the</b> moonlight.
<br>   The hobbits shuddered. Even in <b>the</b> Shire <b>the</b> rumour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-wights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs beyond <b>the</b> Forest had been heard. But <b>it</b> was not a tale that any hobbit liked <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b>, even <b>by</b> a comfortable fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what <b>the</b> joy <b>of</b> this house had driven from their minds: <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Tom Bombadil nestled under <b>the</b> very shoulder <b>of</b> those dreaded hills. They lost <b>the</b> thread <b>of</b> his tale <b>and</b> shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.
<br>   When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered <b>into</b> strange regions beyond their memory <b>and</b> beyond their waking thought, <b>into</b> limes when <b>the</b> world was wider, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seas flowed straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western Shore; <b>and</b> still <b>on</b> <b>and</b> back Tom went singing out <b>into</b> ancient starlight, when only <b>the</b> Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, <b>and</b> they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed as if, under <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> his words, <b>the</b> wind had gone, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> clouds had dried up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> day had been withdrawn, <b>and</b> darkness had come from East <b>and</b> West, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> sky was filled with <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> white stars.
<br>   Whether <b>the</b> morning <b>and</b> evening <b>of</b> one day <b>or</b> <b>of</b> many days had passed Frodo could not tell. He did not feel either hungry <b>or</b> tired, only filled with wonder. The stars shone through <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>the</b> silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavens seemed <b>to</b> be round him. He spoke at last out <b>of</b> his wonder <b>and</b> a sudden fear <b>of</b> that silence:
<br>   “Who are you, Master?” he asked.
<br>   “Eh, what?” said Tom sitting up, <b>and</b> his eyes glinting in <b>the</b> gloom. “Don’t you know my name yet? That’s <b>the</b> only answer. Tell me, who are you, alone, yourself <b>and</b> nameless? But you are young <b>and</b> I am old. Eldest, that’s what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees; Tom remembers <b>the</b> first raindrop <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first acorn. He made paths before <b>the</b> Big People, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> little People arriving. He was here before <b>the</b> Kings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> graves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-wights. When <b>the</b> Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before <b>the</b> seas were bent. He knew <b>the</b> dark under <b>the</b> stars when <b>it</b> was fearless—before <b>the</b> Dark Lord came from Outside.”
<br>   A shadow seemed <b>to</b> pass <b>by</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits glanced hastily through <b>the</b> panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood in <b>the</b> door behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from <b>the</b> draught with her hand; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light flowed through <b>it</b>, like sunlight through a white shell.
<br>   “The rain has ended,” she said; “<b>and</b> new waters are running downhill, under <b>the</b> stars. Let us now laugh <b>and</b> be glad!”
<br>   “And let us have food <b>and</b> drink!” cried Tom. “Long tales are thirsty. And long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, <b>and</b> evening!” With that he jumped out <b>of</b> his chair, <b>and</b> with a bound took a candle from <b>the</b> chimney-shelf <b>and</b> lit <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> flame that Goldberry held; then he danced about <b>the</b> table. Suddenly he hopped through <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> disappeared.
<br>   Quickly he returned, bearing a large <b>and</b> laden tray. Then Tom <b>and</b> Goldberry set <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits sat half in wonder <b>and</b> half in laughter: so fair was <b>the</b> grace <b>of</b> Goldberry <b>and</b> so merry <b>and</b> odd <b>the</b> caperings <b>of</b> Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed <b>to</b> weave a single dance, neither hindering <b>the</b> other, in <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> round about <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> with great speed food <b>and</b> vessels <b>and</b> lights were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white <b>and</b> yellow. Tom bowed <b>to</b> his guests. “Supper is ready,” said Goldberry; <b>and</b> now <b>the</b> hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle, <b>and</b> her shoes were like fishes” mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, <b>and</b> he had green stockings.
<br>   It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> Tom’s words may have missed one meal <b>or</b> many, <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> food was before them <b>it</b> seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing <b>or</b> even speak much for a while, <b>and</b> paid close attention <b>to</b> business. But after a time their hearts <b>and</b> spirit rose high again, <b>and</b> their voices rang out in mirth <b>and</b> laughter.
<br>   After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that began merrily in <b>the</b> hills <b>and</b> fell softly down <b>into</b> silence; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> silences they saw in their minds pools <b>and</b> waters wider than any they had known, <b>and</b> looking <b>into</b> them they saw <b>the</b> sky below them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stars like jewels in <b>the</b> depths. Then once more she wished them each good night <b>and</b> left them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake <b>and</b> plied them with questions.
<br>   He appeared already <b>to</b> know much about them <b>and</b> all their families, <b>and</b> indeed <b>to</b> know much <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> history <b>and</b> doings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire down from days hardly remembered among <b>the</b> hobbits themselves. It <b>no</b> longer surprised them; <b>but</b> he made <b>no</b> secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely <b>to</b> Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed <b>to</b> regard as a person <b>of</b> more importance than they had imagined. “There’s earth under his old feet, <b>and</b> clay <b>on</b> his fingers; wisdom in his bones, <b>and</b> both his eyes are open,” said Tom. It was also clear that Tom had dealings with <b>the</b> Elves, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning <b>the</b> flight <b>of</b> Frodo.
<br>   Indeed so much did Tom know, <b>and</b> so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo <b>and</b> his own hopes <b>and</b> fears than he had told before even <b>to</b> Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up <b>and</b> down, <b>and</b> there was a glint in his eyes when he heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders.
<br>   “Show me <b>the</b> precious Ring!” he said suddenly in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story: <b>and</b> Frodo, <b>to</b> his own astonishment, drew out <b>the</b> chain from his pocket, <b>and</b> unfastening <b>the</b> Ring handed <b>it</b> at once <b>to</b> Tom.
<br>   It seemed <b>to</b> grow larger as <b>it</b> lay for a moment <b>on</b> his big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his eye <b>and</b> laughed. For a second <b>the</b> hobbits had a vision, both comical <b>and</b> alarming, <b>of</b> his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle <b>of</b> gold. Then Tom put <b>the</b> Ring round <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his little finger <b>and</b> held <b>it</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> candlelight. For a moment <b>the</b> hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> Tom disappearing!
<br>   Tom laughed again, <b>and</b> then he spun <b>the</b> Ring in <b>the</b> air—<b>and</b> <b>it</b> vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry—<b>and</b> Tom leaned forward <b>and</b> handed <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> him with a smile.
<br>   Frodo looked at <b>it</b> closely, <b>and</b> rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket <b>to</b> a juggler). It was <b>the</b> same Ring, <b>or</b> looked <b>the</b> same <b>and</b> weighed <b>the</b> same: for that Ring had always seemed <b>to</b> Frodo <b>to</b> weigh strangely heavy in <b>the</b> hand. But something prompted him <b>to</b> make sure. He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming <b>to</b> make so light <b>of</b> what even Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when <b>the</b> talk was going again, <b>and</b> Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers <b>and</b> their queer ways—then he slipped <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b>.
<br>   Merry turned towards him <b>to</b> say something <b>and</b> gave a start, <b>and</b> checked an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): <b>it</b> was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, <b>and</b> obviously could not see him. He got up <b>and</b> crept quietly away from <b>the</b> fireside towards <b>the</b> outer door.
<br>   “Hey there!” cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes. “Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand’s more fair without <b>it</b>. Come back! Leave your game <b>and</b> sit down beside me! We must talk a while more, <b>and</b> think about <b>the</b> morning. Tom must teach <b>the</b> right road, <b>and</b> keep your feet from wandering.”
<br>   Frodo laughed (trying <b>to</b> feel pleased), <b>and</b> taking off <b>the</b> Ring he came <b>and</b> sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned <b>the</b> Sun would shine tomorrow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would be a glad morning, <b>and</b> setting out would be hopeful. But they would do well <b>to</b> start early; for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure <b>of</b> for long, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. “I am <b>no</b> weather-master,” he said; “nor is aught that goes <b>on</b> two legs.”
<br>   By his advice they decided <b>to</b> make nearly due North from his house, over <b>the</b> western <b>and</b> lower slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs: they might hope in that way <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> East Road in a day’s journey, <b>and</b> avoid <b>the</b> Barrows. He told them not <b>to</b> be afraid—<b>but</b> <b>to</b> mind their own business.
<br>   “Keep <b>to</b> <b>the</b> green grass. Don’t you go a-meddling with old stone <b>or</b> cold Wights <b>or</b> prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter!” He said this more than once; <b>and</b> he advised them <b>to</b> pass barrows <b>by</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west-side, if they chanced <b>to</b> stray near one. Then he taught them a rhyme <b>to</b> sing, if they should <b>by</b> ill-luck fall <b>into</b> any danger <b>or</b> difficulty <b>the</b> next day.
<br>   
<br>Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
<br>By water, wood <b>and</b> hill, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reed <b>and</b> willow,
<br>By fire, sun <b>and</b> moon, harken now <b>and</b> hear us!
<br>Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!
<br>   
<br>   When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder with a laugh, <b>and</b> taking candles led them back <b>to</b> their bedroom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS
<br>
<br>   That night they heard <b>no</b> noises. But either in his dreams <b>or</b> out <b>of</b> them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind; a song that seemed <b>to</b> come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, <b>and</b> growing stronger <b>to</b> turn <b>the</b> veil all <b>to</b> glass <b>and</b> silver, until at last <b>it</b> was rolled back, <b>and</b> a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.
<br>   The vision melted <b>into</b> waking; <b>and</b> there was Tom whistling like a tree-full <b>of</b> birds; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun was already slanting down <b>the</b> hill <b>and</b> through <b>the</b> open window. Outside everything was green <b>and</b> pale gold.
<br>   After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready <b>to</b> say farewell, as nearly heavy <b>of</b> heart as was possible <b>on</b> such a morning: cool, bright, <b>and</b> clean under a washed autumn sky <b>of</b> thin blue. The air came fresh from <b>the</b> North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing <b>and</b> moving restlessly. Tom came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>and</b> waved his hat <b>and</b> danced upon <b>the</b> doorstep, bidding <b>the</b> hobbits <b>to</b> get up <b>and</b> be off <b>and</b> go with good speed.
<br>   They rode off along a path that wound away from behind <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> went slanting up towards <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill-brow under which <b>it</b> sheltered. They had just dismounted <b>to</b> lead their ponies up <b>the</b> last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.
<br>   “Goldberry!” he cried. “My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have never said farewell <b>to</b> her, nor seen her since <b>the</b> evening!” He was so distressed that he turned back; <b>but</b> at that moment a clear call came rippling down. There <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-brow she stood beckoning <b>to</b> them: her hair was flying loose, <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> caught <b>the</b> sun <b>it</b> shone <b>and</b> shimmered. A light like <b>the</b> glint <b>of</b> water <b>on</b> dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced.
<br>   They hastened up <b>the</b> last slope, <b>and</b> stood breathless beside her. They bowed, <b>but</b> with a wave <b>of</b> her arm she bade them look round; <b>and</b> they looked out from <b>the</b> hill-top over lands under <b>the</b> morning. It was now as clear <b>and</b> far-seen as <b>it</b> had been veiled <b>and</b> misty when they stood upon <b>the</b> knoll in <b>the</b> Forest, which could now be seen rising pale <b>and</b> green out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark trees in <b>the</b> West. In that direction <b>the</b> land rose in wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet under <b>the</b> sun, beyond which lay hidden <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine. To <b>the</b> South, over <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle, there was a distant glint like pale glass where <b>the</b> Brandywine River made a great loop in <b>the</b> lowlands <b>and</b> flowed away out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. Northward beyond <b>the</b> dwindling downs <b>the</b> land ran away in flats <b>and</b> swellings <b>of</b> grey <b>and</b> green <b>and</b> pale earth-colours, until <b>it</b> faded <b>into</b> a featureless <b>and</b> shadowy distance. Eastward <b>the</b> Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> morning, <b>and</b> vanished out <b>of</b> eyesight <b>into</b> a guess: <b>it</b> was <b>no</b> more than a guess <b>of</b> blue <b>and</b> a remote white glimmer blending with <b>the</b> hem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> spoke <b>to</b> them, out <b>of</b> memory <b>and</b> old tales, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high <b>and</b> distant mountains.
<br>   They took a deep draught <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> felt that a skip <b>and</b> a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted <b>to</b> go jogging aside over <b>the</b> crumpled skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> downs towards <b>the</b> Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over <b>the</b> stepping stones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills straight towards <b>the</b> Mountains.
<br>   Goldberry spoke <b>to</b> them <b>and</b> recalled their eyes <b>and</b> thoughts. “Speed now, fair guests!” she said. “And hold <b>to</b> your purpose! North with <b>the</b> wind in <b>the</b> left eye <b>and</b> a blessing <b>on</b> your footsteps! Make haste while <b>the</b> Sun shines!” And <b>to</b> Frodo she said: “Farewell, Elf-friend, <b>it</b> was a merry meeting!”
<br>   But Frodo found <b>no</b> words <b>to</b> answer. He bowed low, <b>and</b> mounted his pony, <b>and</b> followed <b>by</b> his friends jogged slowly down <b>the</b> gentle slope behind <b>the</b> hill. Tom Bombadil's house <b>and</b> <b>the</b> valley, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Forest were lost <b>to</b> view. The air grew warmer between <b>the</b> green walls <b>of</b> hillside <b>and</b> hillside, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> turf rose strong <b>and</b> sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small <b>and</b> slender like a sunlit flower against <b>the</b> sky: she was standing still watching them, <b>and</b> her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked she gave a clear call, <b>and</b> lifting up her hand she turned <b>and</b> vanished behind <b>the</b> hill.
<br>   Their way wound along <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hollow, <b>and</b> round <b>the</b> green feet <b>of</b> a steep hill <b>into</b> another deeper <b>and</b> broader valley, <b>and</b> then over <b>the</b> shoulder <b>of</b> further hills, <b>and</b> down their long limbs, <b>and</b> up their smooth sides again, up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> new hill-tops <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> new valleys. There was <b>no</b> tree nor any visible water: <b>it</b> was a country <b>of</b> grass <b>and</b> short springy turf, silent except for <b>the</b> whisper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air over <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land, <b>and</b> high lonely cries <b>of</b> strange birds. As they journeyed <b>the</b> sun mounted, <b>and</b> grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge <b>the</b> breeze seemed <b>to</b> have grown less. When they caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country westward <b>the</b> distant Forest seemed <b>to</b> be smoking, as if <b>the</b> fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf <b>and</b> root <b>and</b> mould. A shadow now lay round <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> sight, a dark haze above which <b>the</b> upper sky was like a blue cap, hot <b>and</b> heavy.
<br>   About mid-day they came <b>to</b> a hill whose top was wide <b>and</b> flattened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there was <b>no</b> air stirring, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky seemed near their heads. They rode across <b>and</b> looked northwards. Then their hearts rose, for <b>it</b> seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected. Certainly <b>the</b> distances had now all become hazy <b>and</b> deceptive, <b>but</b> there could be <b>no</b> doubt that <b>the</b> Downs were coming <b>to</b> an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards, until <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line. That is a line <b>of</b> trees,” said Merry, “<b>and</b> that must mark <b>the</b> Road. All along <b>it</b> for many leagues east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bridge there are trees growing. Some say they were planted in <b>the</b> old days.”
<br>   “Splendid!” said Frodo. “If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning, we shall have left <b>the</b> Downs before <b>the</b> Sun sets <b>and</b> be jogging <b>on</b> in search <b>of</b> a camping place.” But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, <b>and</b> he saw that <b>on</b> that side <b>the</b> hills were higher <b>and</b> looked down upon them; <b>and</b> all those hills were crowned with green mounds, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out <b>of</b> green gums.
<br>   That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from <b>the</b> sight <b>and</b> went down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hollow circle. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>it</b> there stood a single stone, standing tall under <b>the</b> sun above, <b>and</b> at this hour casting <b>no</b> shadow. It was shapeless <b>and</b> yet significant: like a landmark, <b>or</b> a guarding finger, <b>or</b> more like a warning. But they were now hungry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun was still at <b>the</b> fearless noon; so they set their backs against <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stone. It was cool, as if <b>the</b> sun had had <b>no</b> power <b>to</b> warm <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> at that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food <b>and</b> drink, <b>and</b> made as good a noon-meal under <b>the</b> open sky as anyone could wish; for <b>the</b> food came from “down under Hill”. Tom had provided them with plenty for <b>the</b> comfort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   Riding over <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> eating their fill, <b>the</b> warm sun <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs <b>and</b> looking at <b>the</b> sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough <b>to</b> explain what happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly <b>and</b> uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant <b>to</b> take. The standing stone was cold, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. The sun, a pale <b>and</b> watery yellow, was gleaming through <b>the</b> mist just above <b>the</b> west wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hollow in which they lay; north, south, <b>and</b> east, beyond <b>the</b> wall <b>the</b> fog was thick, cold <b>and</b> white. The air was silent, heavy <b>and</b> chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down.
<br>   The hobbits sprang <b>to</b> their feet in alarm, <b>and</b> ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western rim. They found that they were upon an island in <b>the</b> fog. Even as they looked out in dismay towards <b>the</b> setting sun, <b>it</b> sank before their eyes <b>into</b> a white sea, <b>and</b> a cold grey shadow sprang up in <b>the</b> East behind. The fog rolled up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls <b>and</b> rose above them, <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> mounted <b>it</b> bent over their heads until <b>it</b> became a roof: they were shut in a hall <b>of</b> mist whose central pillar was <b>the</b> standing stone.
<br>   They felt as if a trap was closing about them; <b>but</b> they did not quite lose heart. They still remembered <b>the</b> hopeful view they had had <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road ahead, <b>and</b> they still knew in which direction <b>it</b> lay. In any case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about <b>the</b> stone that <b>no</b> thought <b>of</b> remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work.
<br>   Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over <b>the</b> rim <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> long northward slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, down <b>into</b> a foggy sea. As they went down <b>the</b> mist became colder <b>and</b> damper, <b>and</b> their hair hung lank <b>and</b> dripping <b>on</b> their foreheads. When they reached <b>the</b> bottom <b>it</b> was so cold that they halted <b>and</b> got out cloaks <b>and</b> hoods, which soon became bedewed with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly <b>on</b> again, feeling their way <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rise <b>and</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. They were steering, as well as they could guess, for <b>the</b> gate-like opening at <b>the</b> far northward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long valley which they had seen in <b>the</b> morning. Once they were through <b>the</b> gap, they had only lo keep <b>on</b> in anything like a straight line <b>and</b> they were bound in <b>the</b> end <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> Road. Their thoughts did not go beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond <b>the</b> Downs there might be <b>no</b> fog.
<br>   Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated <b>and</b> wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam was behind him, <b>and</b> after him came Pippin, <b>and</b> then Merry. The valley seemed <b>to</b> stretch <b>on</b> endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began <b>to</b> loom through <b>the</b> mist; <b>and</b> he guessed that they were at last approaching <b>the</b> gap in <b>the</b> hills, <b>the</b> north-gate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free.
<br>   “Come <b>on</b>! Follow me!” he called back over his shoulder, <b>and</b> he hurried forward. But his hope soon changed <b>to</b> bewilderment <b>and</b> alarm. The dark patches grew darker, <b>but</b> they shrank; <b>and</b> suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him <b>and</b> leaning slightly towards one another like <b>the</b> pillars <b>of</b> a headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen any sign <b>of</b> these in <b>the</b> valley, when he looked out from <b>the</b> hill in <b>the</b> morning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware: <b>and</b> even as he did so darkness seemed <b>to</b> fall round him. His pony reared <b>and</b> snorted, <b>and</b> he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: <b>the</b> others had not followed him. “Sam!” he called. “Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don't you keep up?”
<br>   There was <b>no</b> answer. Fear took him, <b>and</b> he ran back past <b>the</b> stones shouting wildly: “Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!” The pony bolted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist <b>and</b> vanished. From some way off, <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> seemed, he thought he heard a cry: “Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!” It was away eastward, <b>on</b> his left as he stood under <b>the</b> great stones, staring <b>and</b> straining <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom. He plunged off in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> call, <b>and</b> found himself going steeply uphill.
<br>   As he struggled <b>on</b> he called again, <b>and</b> kept <b>on</b> calling more <b>and</b> more frantically; <b>but</b> he heard <b>no</b> answer for some time, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> seemed faint <b>and</b> far ahead <b>and</b> high above him. “Frodo! Hoy!” came <b>the</b> thin voices out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mist: <b>and</b> then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated, ending with a last help! that trailed off <b>into</b> a long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward with all <b>the</b> speed he could towards <b>the</b> cries; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> light was now gone, <b>and</b> clinging night had closed about him, so that <b>it</b> was impossible <b>to</b> be sure <b>of</b> any direction. He seemed all <b>the</b> time <b>to</b> be climbing up <b>and</b> up.
<br>   Only <b>the</b> change in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground at his feet told him when he at last came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a ridge <b>or</b> hill. He was weary, sweating <b>and</b> yet chilled. It was wholly dark.
<br>   “Where are you?” he cried out miserably.
<br>   There was <b>no</b> reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that <b>it</b> was getting very cold, <b>and</b> that up here a wind was beginning <b>to</b> blow, an icy wind. A change was coming in <b>the</b> weather. The mist was flowing past him now in shreds <b>and</b> tatters. His breath was smoking, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> darkness was less near <b>and</b> thick. He looked up <b>and</b> saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid <b>the</b> strands <b>of</b> hurrying cloud <b>and</b> fog. The wind began <b>to</b> hiss over <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, <b>and</b> he made towards <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> even as he went forward <b>the</b> mist was rolled up <b>and</b> thrust aside, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing southwards <b>and</b> was <b>on</b> a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from <b>the</b> north. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> biting wind was blowing. To his right there loomed against <b>the</b> westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood there.
<br>   “Where are you?” he cried again, both angry <b>and</b> afraid.
<br>   “Here!” said a voice, deep <b>and</b> cold, that seemed <b>to</b> come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. “I am waiting for you!”
<br>   “No!” said Frodo; <b>but</b> he did not run away. His knees gave, <b>and</b> he fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Nothing happened, <b>and</b> there was <b>no</b> sound. Trembling he looked up, in time <b>to</b> see a tall dark figure like a shadow against <b>the</b> stars. It leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed <b>to</b> come from some remote distance. Then a grip stronger <b>and</b> colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, <b>and</b> he remembered <b>no</b> more.
<br>   When he came <b>to</b> himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense <b>of</b> dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight had taken him, <b>and</b> he was probably already under <b>the</b> dreadful spells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-wights about which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, <b>but</b> lay as he found himself: flat <b>on</b> his back upon a cold stone with his hands <b>on</b> his breast.
<br>   But though his fear was so great that <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins <b>and</b> his stories, <b>of</b> their jogging along together in <b>the</b> lanes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> talking about roads <b>and</b> adventures. There is a seed <b>of</b> courage hidden (often deeply, <b>it</b> is true) in <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fattest <b>and</b> most timid hobbit, wailing for some final <b>and</b> desperate danger <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> grow. Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know <b>it</b>, Bilbo (<b>and</b> Gandalf) had thought him <b>the</b> best hobbit in <b>the</b> Shire. He thought he had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his adventure, <b>and</b> a terrible end, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> thought hardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he <b>no</b> longer felt limp like a helpless prey.
<br>   As he lay there, thinking <b>and</b> getting a hold <b>of</b> himself, he noticed all at once that <b>the</b> darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind <b>of</b> a place he was in, for <b>the</b> light seemed <b>to</b> be coming out <b>of</b> himself, <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> floor beside him, <b>and</b> had not yet reached <b>the</b> roof <b>or</b> wall. He turned, <b>and</b> there in <b>the</b> cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, <b>and</b> Merry. They were <b>on</b> their backs, <b>and</b> their faces looked deathly pale; <b>and</b> they were clad in white. About them lay many treasures, <b>of</b> gold maybe, though in that light they looked cold <b>and</b> unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about their waists, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> their fingers were many rings. Swords lay <b>by</b> their sides, <b>and</b> shields were at their feet. But across their three necks lay one long naked sword.
<br>   Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising <b>and</b> falling. The voice seemed far away <b>and</b> immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in <b>the</b> air <b>and</b> thin, sometimes like a low moan from <b>the</b> ground. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formless stream <b>of</b> sad <b>but</b> horrible sounds, strings <b>of</b> words would now <b>and</b> again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless <b>and</b> miserable. The night was railing against <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> which <b>it</b> was bereaved, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cold was cursing <b>the</b> warmth for which <b>it</b> hungered. Frodo was chilled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marrow. After a while <b>the</b> song became clearer, <b>and</b> with dread in his heart he perceived that <b>it</b> had changed <b>into</b> an incantation:
<br>   
<br>Cold be hand <b>and</b> heart <b>and</b> bone,
<br><b>and</b> cold be sleep under stone:
<br>never mare <b>to</b> wake <b>on</b> stony bed,
<br>never, till <b>the</b> Sun fails <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Moon is dead.
<br>In <b>the</b> black wind <b>the</b> stars shall die,
<br><b>and</b> still <b>on</b> gold here let them lie,
<br>till <b>the</b> dark lord lifts his hand
<br>over dead sea <b>and</b> withered land.
<br>   
<br>   He heard behind his head a creaking <b>and</b> scraping sound. Raising himself <b>on</b> one arm he looked, <b>and</b> saw now in <b>the</b> pale light that they were in a kind <b>of</b> passage which behind them turned a corner. Round <b>the</b> corner a long arm was groping, walking <b>on</b> its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, <b>and</b> towards <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword that lay upon him.
<br>   At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned <b>into</b> stone <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incantation. Then a wild thought <b>of</b> escape came <b>to</b> him. He wondered if he put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring, whether <b>the</b> Barrow-wight would miss him, <b>and</b> he might find some way out. He thought <b>of</b> himself running free over <b>the</b> grass, grieving for Merry, <b>and</b> Sam, <b>and</b> Pippin, <b>but</b> free <b>and</b> alive himself. Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do.
<br>   But <b>the</b> courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket, <b>and</b> then fought with himself again; <b>and</b> as he did so <b>the</b> arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened in him, <b>and</b> he seized a short sword that lay beside him, <b>and</b> kneeling he stooped low over <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> his companions. With what strength he had he hewed at <b>the</b> crawling arm near <b>the</b> wrist, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hand broke off; <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> same moment <b>the</b> sword splintered up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hilt. There was a shriek <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light vanished. In <b>the</b> dark there was a snarling noise.
<br>   Frodo fell forward over Merry, <b>and</b> Merry's face felt cold. All at once back <b>into</b> his mind, from which <b>it</b> had disappeared with <b>the</b> first coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fog, came <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house down under <b>the</b> Hill, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Tom singing. He remembered <b>the</b> rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a small desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! <b>and</b> with that name his voice seemed <b>to</b> grow strong: <b>it</b> had a full <b>and</b> lively sound, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dark chamber echoed as if <b>to</b> drum <b>and</b> trumpet.
<br>   
<br>Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
<br>By water, wood <b>and</b> hill, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reed <b>and</b> willow,
<br>By fire, sun <b>and</b> moon, harken now <b>and</b> hear us!
<br>Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!
<br>   
<br>   There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, <b>but</b> far away, as if <b>it</b> was coming down through <b>the</b> ground <b>or</b> through thick walls, an answering voice singing:
<br>   
<br>Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,
<br>Bright blue his jacket is, <b>and</b> his boots are yellow.
<br>None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is <b>the</b> master:
<br>His songs are stronger songs, <b>and</b> his feet are faster.
<br>   
<br>   There was a loud rumbling sound, as <b>of</b> stones rolling <b>and</b> falling, <b>and</b> suddenly light streamed in, real light, <b>the</b> plain light <b>of</b> day. A low door-like opening appeared at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber beyond Frodo's feet; <b>and</b> there was Tom's head (hat, feather, <b>and</b> all) framed against <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon <b>the</b> floor, <b>and</b> upon <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep.
<br>   Tom stooped, removed his hat, <b>and</b> came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark chamber, singing:
<br>   
<br>Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in <b>the</b> sunlight!
<br>Shrivel like <b>the</b> cold mist, like <b>the</b> winds go wailing,
<br>Out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> barren lands far beyond <b>the</b> mountains!
<br>Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!
<br>Lost <b>and</b> forgotten be, darker than <b>the</b> darkness,
<br>Where gates stand for ever shut, till <b>the</b> world is mended.
<br>   
<br>   At these words there was a cry <b>and</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away <b>into</b> an unguessable distance; <b>and</b> after that silence.
<br>   “Come, friend Frodo!” said Tom. “Let us get out <b>on</b> <b>to</b> clean grass! You must help me bear them.”
<br>   Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, <b>and</b> Sam. As Frodo left <b>the</b> barrow for <b>the</b> last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap <b>of</b> fallen earth. Tom went back in again, <b>and</b> there was a sound <b>of</b> much thumping <b>and</b> stamping. When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load <b>of</b> treasure: things <b>of</b> gold, silver, copper, <b>and</b> bronze; many beads <b>and</b> chains <b>and</b> jewelled ornaments. He climbed <b>the</b> green barrow <b>and</b> laid them all <b>on</b> top in <b>the</b> sunshine.
<br>   There he stood, with his hat in his hand <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind in his hair, <b>and</b> looked down upon <b>the</b> three hobbits, that had been laid <b>on</b> their backs upon <b>the</b> grass at <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mound. Raising his right hand he said in a clear <b>and</b> commanding voice:
<br>   
<br>Wake now my merry tads! Wake <b>and</b> hear me calling!
<br>Warm now be heart <b>and</b> limb! The cold stone is fallen;
<br>Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.
<br>Night under Night is flown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gate is open!
<br>   
<br>   To Frodo's great joy <b>the</b> hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes, <b>and</b> then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement, first at Frodo, <b>and</b> then at Tom standing large as life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barrow-top above them; <b>and</b> then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned <b>and</b> belted with pale gold, <b>and</b> jingling with trinkets.
<br>   “What in <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> wonder?” began Merry, feeling <b>the</b> golden circlet that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, <b>and</b> a shadow came over his face, <b>and</b> he closed his eyes. “Of course, I remember!” he said. “The men <b>of</b> Carn D?m came <b>on</b> us at night, <b>and</b> we were worsted. Ah! <b>the</b> spear in my heart!” He clutched at his breast. “No! No!” he said, opening his eyes. “What am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get <b>to</b>, Frodo?”
<br>   “I thought that I was lost,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> I don't want <b>to</b> speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Let us think <b>of</b> what we are <b>to</b> do now! Let us go <b>on</b>!”
<br>   “Dressed up like this, sir?” said Sam. “Where are my clothes?” He flung his circlet, belt, <b>and</b> rings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> looked round helplessly, as if he expected <b>to</b> find his cloak, jacket, <b>and</b> breeches, <b>and</b> other hobbit-garments lying somewhere <b>to</b> hand.
<br>   “You won't find your clothes again,” said Tom, bounding down from <b>the</b> mound, <b>and</b> laughing as he danced round them in <b>the</b> sunlight. One would have thought that nothing dangerous <b>or</b> dreadful had happened; <b>and</b> indeed <b>the</b> horror faded out <b>of</b> their hearts as they looked at him, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> merry glint in his eyes.
<br>   “What do you mean?” asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled <b>and</b> half amused. “Why not?”
<br>   But Tom shook his head, saying: “You've found yourselves again, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep water. Clothes are <b>but</b> little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be glad, my merry friends, <b>and</b> let <b>the</b> warm sunlight heal now heart <b>and</b> limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!”
<br>   He sprang away down hill, whistling <b>and</b> calling. Looking down after him Frodo saw him running away southwards along <b>the</b> green hollow between their hill <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next, still whistling <b>and</b> crying:
<br>   
<br>Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?
<br>Up, down, near <b>or</b> far, here, there <b>or</b> yonder?
<br>Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail <b>and</b> Bumpkin,
<br>White-socks my little lad, <b>and</b> old Fatty Lumpkin!
<br>   
<br>   So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat <b>and</b> catching <b>it</b>, until he was hidden <b>by</b> a fold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground: <b>but</b> for some time his hey now! hoy now! came floating back down <b>the</b> wind, which had shifted round towards <b>the</b> south.
<br>   The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in <b>the</b> sun with <b>the</b> delight <b>of</b> those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter <b>to</b> a friendly clime, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> people that, after being long ill <b>and</b> bedridden, wake one day <b>to</b> find that they are unexpectedly well <b>and</b> <b>the</b> day is again full <b>of</b> promise.
<br>   By <b>the</b> time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (<b>and</b> hungry). He reappeared, hat first, over <b>the</b> brow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> behind him came in an obedient line six ponies: their own five <b>and</b> one more. The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (<b>and</b> older) than their own ponies. Merry, <b>to</b> whom <b>the</b> others belonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, <b>but</b> they answered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new names that Tom had given them for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> their lives. Tom called them one <b>by</b> one <b>and</b> they climbed over <b>the</b> brow <b>and</b> stood in a line. Then Tom bowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Here are your ponies, now!” he said. “They've more sense (in some ways) than you wandering hobbits have—more sense in their noses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right <b>into</b>; <b>and</b> if they run <b>to</b> save themselves, then they run <b>the</b> right way. You must forgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, <b>to</b> face fear <b>of</b> Barrow-wights is not what they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!”
<br>   Merry, Sam, <b>and</b> Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; <b>and</b> they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged <b>to</b> put <b>on</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thicker <b>and</b> warmer things that they had brought against <b>the</b> oncoming <b>of</b> winter.
<br>   “Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “He's mine,” said Tom. “My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, <b>and</b> he wanders often far, free upon <b>the</b> hillsides. When your ponies stayed with me, they got <b>to</b> know my Lumpkin; <b>and</b> they smelt him in <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> quickly ran <b>to</b> meet him. I thought he'd look for them <b>and</b> with his words <b>of</b> wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom's going <b>to</b> ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just <b>to</b> set you <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road; so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk <b>to</b> hobbits that are riding, when you're <b>on</b> your own legs trying <b>to</b> trot beside them.”
<br>   The hobbits were delighted <b>to</b> hear this, <b>and</b> thanked Tom many times; <b>but</b> he laughed, <b>and</b> said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> his land. “I've got things <b>to</b> do,” he said: “my making <b>and</b> my singing, my talking <b>and</b> my walking, <b>and</b> my watching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. Tom can't be always near <b>to</b> open doors <b>and</b> willow-cracks. Tom has his house <b>to</b> mind, <b>and</b> Goldberry is waiting.”
<br>   It was still fairly early <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sun, something between nine <b>and</b> ten, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits turned their minds <b>to</b> food. Their last meal had been lunch beside <b>the</b> standing stone <b>the</b> day before. They breakfasted now off <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> Tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> circumstances), <b>but</b> they felt much better for <b>it</b>. While they were eating Tom went up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mound, <b>and</b> looked through <b>the</b> treasures. Most <b>of</b> these he made <b>into</b> a pile that glistened <b>and</b> sparkled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass. He bade them lie there “free <b>to</b> all finders, birds, beasts. Elves <b>or</b> Men, <b>and</b> all kindly creatures”; for so <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mound should be broken <b>and</b> scattered <b>and</b> <b>no</b> Wight ever come back <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. He chose for himself from <b>the</b> pile a brooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers <b>or</b> <b>the</b> wings <b>of</b> blue butterflies. He looked long at <b>it</b>, as if stirred <b>by</b> some memory, shaking his head, <b>and</b> saying at last:
<br>   “Here is a pretty toy for Tom <b>and</b> for his lady! Fair was she who long ago wore this <b>on</b> her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear <b>it</b> now, <b>and</b> we will not forget her!”
<br>   For each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, <b>and</b> keen, <b>of</b> marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red <b>and</b> gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought <b>of</b> some strange metal, light <b>and</b> strong, <b>and</b> set with many fiery stones. Whether <b>by</b> some virtue in these sheaths <b>or</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spell that lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mound, <b>the</b> blades seemed untouched <b>by</b> time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in <b>the</b> sun.
<br>   “Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,” he said. “Sharp blades are good <b>to</b> have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, <b>or</b> far away <b>into</b> dark <b>and</b> danger.” Then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago <b>by</b> Men <b>of</b> Westernesse: they were foes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord, <b>but</b> they were overcome <b>by</b> <b>the</b> evil king <b>of</b> Carn D?m in <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Angmar.
<br>   “Few now remember them,” Tom murmured, “yet still some go wandering, sons <b>of</b> forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things folk that are heedless.”
<br>   The hobbits did not understand his words, <b>but</b> as he spoke they had a vision as <b>it</b> were <b>of</b> a great expanse <b>of</b> years behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes <b>of</b> Men, tall <b>and</b> grim with bright swords, <b>and</b> last came one with a star <b>on</b> his brow. Then <b>the</b> vision faded, <b>and</b> they were back in <b>the</b> sunlit world. It was time <b>to</b> start again. They made ready, packing their bags <b>and</b> lading their ponies. Their new weapons they hung <b>on</b> their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them very awkward, <b>and</b> wondering if they would be <b>of</b> any use. Fighting had not before occurred <b>to</b> any <b>of</b> them as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adventures in which their flight would land them.
<br>   At last they set off. They led their ponies down <b>the</b> hill; <b>and</b> then mounting they trotted quickly along <b>the</b> valley. They looked back <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old mound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> from <b>it</b> <b>the</b> sunlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gold went up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was hidden from view.
<br>   Though Frodo looked about him <b>on</b> every side he saw <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great stones standing like a gate, <b>and</b> before long they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern gap <b>and</b> rode swiftly through, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land fell away before them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, <b>or</b> before them, <b>on</b> Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was chiefly nonsense, <b>or</b> else perhaps a strange language unknown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those <b>of</b> wonder <b>and</b> delight.
<br>   They went forward steadily, <b>but</b> they soon saw that <b>the</b> Road was further away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from reaching <b>it</b> until after nightfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day before. The dark line they had seen was not a line <b>of</b> trees <b>but</b> a line <b>of</b> bushes growing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a deep dike with a steep wall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> further side. Tom said that <b>it</b> had once been <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> a kingdom, <b>but</b> a very long lime ago. He seemed <b>to</b> remember something sad about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> would not say much.
<br>   They climbed down <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dike <b>and</b> through a gap in <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. The land was now open <b>and</b> fairly level, <b>and</b> they quickened their pace, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line <b>of</b> tall trees ahead, <b>and</b> they knew that they had come back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road after many unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over <b>the</b> last furlongs, <b>and</b> halted under <b>the</b> long shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. They were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a sloping bank, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Road, now dim as evening drew <b>on</b>, wound away below them. At this point <b>it</b> ran nearly from South-west <b>to</b> North-east, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> their right <b>it</b> fell quickly down <b>into</b> a wide hollow. It was rutted <b>and</b> bore many signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent heavy rain; there were pools <b>and</b> pot-holes full <b>of</b> water. They rode down <b>the</b> bank <b>and</b> looked up <b>and</b> down. There was nothing <b>to</b> be seen. “Well, here we are again at last!” said Frodo. “I suppose we haven't lost more than two days <b>by</b> my short cut through <b>the</b> Forest! But perhaps <b>the</b> delay will prove useful—<b>it</b> may have put them off our trail.”
<br>   The others looked at him. The shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered <b>the</b> Forest they had thought chiefly <b>of</b> getting back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road; only now when <b>it</b> lay beneath their feet did they remember <b>the</b> danger which pursued them, <b>and</b> was more than likely <b>to</b> be lying in wait for them upon <b>the</b> Road itself. They looked anxiously back towards <b>the</b> setting sun, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Road was brown <b>and</b> empty.
<br>   “Do you think,” asked Pippin hesitatingly, “do you think we may be pursued, tonight?”
<br>   “No, I hope not tonight,” answered Tom Bombadil; “nor perhaps <b>the</b> next day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my knowledge fails. Tom is not master <b>of</b> Riders from <b>the</b> Black Land far beyond his country.”
<br>   All <b>the</b> same <b>the</b> hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that he would know how <b>to</b> deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would soon now be going forward <b>into</b> lands wholly strange <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> beyond all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> most vague <b>and</b> distant legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> gathering twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness <b>and</b> sense <b>of</b> loss was <b>on</b> them. They stood silent, reluctant <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> final parting, <b>and</b> only slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, <b>and</b> telling them <b>to</b> have good heart <b>and</b> <b>to</b> ride <b>on</b> till dark without halting.
<br>   “Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your own luck must go with you <b>and</b> guide you): four miles along <b>the</b> Road you'll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward. There you'll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony. Barliman Butterbur is <b>the</b> worthy keeper. There you can stay <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> afterwards <b>the</b> morning will speed you upon your way. Be bold, <b>but</b> wary! Keep up your merry hearts, <b>and</b> ride <b>to</b> meet your fortune!”
<br>   They begged him <b>to</b> come at least as far as <b>the</b> inn <b>and</b> drink once more with them; <b>but</b> he laughed <b>and</b> refused, saying:
<br>   Tom's country ends here: he will not pass <b>the</b> borders.
<br>Tom has his house <b>to</b> mind, <b>and</b> Goldberry is waiting!
<br>   Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped <b>on</b> Lumpkin's back, <b>and</b> rode up over <b>the</b> bank <b>and</b> away singing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusk.
<br>   The hobbits climbed up <b>and</b> watched him until he was out <b>of</b> sight.
<br>   “I am sorry <b>to</b> take leave <b>of</b> Master Bombadil,” said Sam. “He's a caution <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further <b>and</b> see naught better, nor queerer. But I won't deny I'll be glad <b>to</b> see this Prancing Pony he spoke <b>of</b>. I hope <b>it</b>'ll be like The Green Dragon away back home! What sort <b>of</b> folk are they in Bree?”
<br>   “There are hobbits in Bree,” said Merry, “as well as Big Folk. I daresay <b>it</b> will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn <b>by</b> all accounts. My people ride out there now <b>and</b> again.”
<br>   “It may be all we could wish,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> is outside <b>the</b> Shire all <b>the</b> same. Don't make yourselves too much at home! Please remember -all <b>of</b> you—that <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given.”
<br>   They now mounted their ponies <b>and</b> rode off silently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> evening. Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill <b>and</b> up again, until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead.
<br>   Before them rose Bree-hill barring <b>the</b> way, a dark mass against misty stars; <b>and</b> under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards <b>it</b> they now hurried desiring only <b>to</b> find a fire, <b>and</b> a door between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY
<br>   
<br>   Bree was <b>the</b> chief village <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land, a small inhabited region, like an island in <b>the</b> empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there was Staddle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, Combe in a deep valley a little further eastward, <b>and</b> Archet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chetwood. Lying round Bree-hill <b>and</b> <b>the</b> villages was a small country <b>of</b> fields <b>and</b> tamed woodland only a few miles broad.
<br>   The Men <b>of</b> Bree were brown-haired, broad, <b>and</b> rather short, cheerful <b>and</b> independent: they belonged <b>to</b> nobody <b>but</b> themselves; <b>but</b> they were more friendly <b>and</b> familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, <b>and</b> other inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world about them than was (<b>or</b> is) usual with Big People. According <b>to</b> their own tales they were <b>the</b> original inhabitants <b>and</b> were <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Men that ever wandered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle-world. Few had survived <b>the</b> turmoils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days; <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> Kings returned again over <b>the</b> Great Sea they had found <b>the</b> Bree-men still there, <b>and</b> they were still there now, when <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Kings had faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   In those days <b>no</b> other Men had settled dwellings so far west, <b>or</b> within a hundred leagues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. But in <b>the</b> wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, <b>and</b> knew nothing <b>of</b> their origin. They were taller <b>and</b> darker than <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Bree <b>and</b> were believed <b>to</b> have strange powers <b>of</b> sight <b>and</b> hearing, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> languages <b>of</b> beasts <b>and</b> birds. They roamed at will southwards, <b>and</b> eastwards even as far as <b>the</b> Misty Mountains; <b>but</b> they were now few <b>and</b> rarely seen. When they appeared they brought news from afar, <b>and</b> told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened <b>to</b>; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk did not make friends <b>of</b> them.
<br>   There were also many families <b>of</b> hobbits in <b>the</b> Bree-land <b>and</b> they claimed <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> oldest settlement <b>of</b> Hobbits in <b>the</b> world, one that was founded long before even <b>the</b> Brandywine was crossed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Shire colonized. They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> higher slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, above <b>the</b> houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Men. The Big Folk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Little Folk (as they called one another) were <b>on</b> friendly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, <b>but</b> both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk. Nowhere else in <b>the</b> world was this peculiar (<b>but</b> excellent) arrangement <b>to</b> be found.
<br>   The Bree-folk, Big <b>and</b> Little, did not themselves travel much; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> affairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four villages were their chief concern. Occasionally <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>of</b> Bree went as far as Buckland, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing; <b>but</b> though their link land was not much further than a day's riding east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge, <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire now seldom visited <b>it</b>. An occasional Bucklander <b>or</b> adventurous Took would come out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Inn for a night <b>or</b> two, <b>but</b> even that was becoming less <b>and</b> less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred <b>to</b> those <b>of</b> Bree, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> any others that lived beyond <b>the</b> borders, as Outsiders, <b>and</b> took very little interest in them, considering them dull <b>and</b> uncouth. There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World in those days than <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were <b>no</b> better than tramps, ready <b>to</b> dig a hole in any bank <b>and</b> stay only as long as <b>it</b> suited them. But in <b>the</b> Bree-land, at any rate, <b>the</b> hobbits were decent <b>and</b> prosperous, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> more rustic than most <b>of</b> their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming <b>and</b> going between <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> Bree. There was Bree-blood in <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>by</b> all accounts.
<br>   The village <b>of</b> Bree had some hundred stone houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Folk, mostly above <b>the</b> Road, nestling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hillside with windows looking west. On that side, running in more than half a circle from <b>the</b> hill <b>and</b> back <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inner side. Over this <b>the</b> Road crossed <b>by</b> a causeway; <b>but</b> where <b>it</b> pierced <b>the</b> hedge <b>it</b> was barred <b>by</b> a great gate. There was another gate in <b>the</b> southern comer where <b>the</b> Road ran out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village. The gates were closed at nightfall; <b>but</b> just inside them were small lodges for <b>the</b> gatekeepers.
<br>   Down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road, where <b>it</b> swept <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right <b>to</b> go round <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when <b>the</b> traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting <b>of</b> ways; another ancient road crossed <b>the</b> East Road just outside (he dike at <b>the</b> western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, <b>and</b> in former days Men <b>and</b> other folk <b>of</b> various sorts had travelled much <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Strange as News from Bree was still a saying in <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, South, <b>and</b> East could be heard in <b>the</b> inn, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> Shire-hobbits used <b>to</b> go more often <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b>. But <b>the</b> Northern Lands had long been desolate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> North Road was now seldom used: <b>it</b> was grass-grown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk called <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Greenway.
<br>   The Inn <b>of</b> Bree was still there, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> innkeeper was an important person. His house was a meeting place for <b>the</b> idle, talkative, <b>and</b> inquisitive among <b>the</b> inhabitants, large <b>and</b> small, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four villages; <b>and</b> a resort <b>of</b> Rangers <b>and</b> other wanderers, <b>and</b> for such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> East Road, <b>to</b> <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> Mountains.
<br>   It was dark, <b>and</b> white stars were shining, when Frodo <b>and</b> his companions came at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greenway-crossing <b>and</b> drew near <b>the</b> village. They came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West-gate <b>and</b> found <b>it</b> shut, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lodge beyond <b>it</b>, there was a man sitting. He jumped up <b>and</b> fetched a lantern <b>and</b> looked over <b>the</b> gate at them in surprise.
<br>   “What do you want, <b>and</b> where do you come from?” he asked gruffly.
<br>   “We are making for <b>the</b> inn here,” answered Frodo. “We are journeying east <b>and</b> cannot go further tonight.”
<br>   “Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what's more, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>by</b> their talk,” said <b>the</b> gatekeeper, softly as if speaking <b>to</b> himself. He stared at them darkly for a moment, <b>and</b> then slowly opened <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> let them ride through.
<br>   “We don't often see Shire-folk riding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road at night,” he went <b>on</b>, as they halted a moment <b>by</b> his door. “You'll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east <b>of</b> Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?”
<br>   “Our names <b>and</b> our business are our own, <b>and</b> this does not seem a good place <b>to</b> discuss them,” said Frodo, not liking <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man <b>or</b> <b>the</b> tone <b>of</b> his voice.
<br>   “Your business is your own, <b>no</b> doubt,” said <b>the</b> man; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s my business <b>to</b> ask questions after nightfall.”
<br>   “We are hobbits from Buckland, <b>and</b> we have a fancy <b>to</b> travel <b>and</b> <b>to</b> stay at <b>the</b> inn here,” put in Merry. “I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough for you? The Bree-folk used <b>to</b> be fair-spoken <b>to</b> travellers, <b>or</b> so I had heard.”
<br>   “All right, all right!” said <b>the</b> man. “I meant <b>no</b> offence. But you'll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at <b>the</b> gate will be asking you questions. There's queer folk about. If you go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> The Pony, you'll find you're oat <b>the</b> only guests.”
<br>   He wished them good night, <b>and</b> they said <b>no</b> more; <b>but</b> Frodo could see in <b>the</b> lantern-light that <b>the</b> man was still eyeing them curiously. He was glad <b>to</b> hear <b>the</b> gate clang <b>to</b> behind them, as they rode forward. He wondered why <b>the</b> man was so suspicious, <b>and</b> whether any one had been asking for news <b>of</b> a party <b>of</b> hobbits. Could <b>it</b> have been Gandalf? He might have arrived, while they were delayed in <b>the</b> Forest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Downs. But there was something in <b>the</b> look <b>and</b> <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gatekeeper that made him uneasy.
<br>   The man stared after <b>the</b> hobbits for a moment, <b>and</b> then he went back <b>to</b> his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in over <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> melted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village street.
<br>   The hobbits rode <b>on</b> up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, <b>and</b> drew up outside <b>the</b> inn. The houses looked large <b>and</b> strange <b>to</b> them. Sam stared up at <b>the</b> inn with its three storeys <b>and</b> many windows, <b>and</b> felt his heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, <b>and</b> other creatures even more terrifying, some time <b>or</b> other in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> his journey; <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> moment he was finding his first sight <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for <b>the</b> dark end <b>of</b> a tiring day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inn-yard, <b>and</b> Black Riders peering out <b>of</b> dark upper windows.
<br>   “We surely aren't going <b>to</b> stay here for <b>the</b> night, are we, sir?” he exclaimed. “If there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why don't we look for some that would be willing <b>to</b> take us in? It would be more homelike.”
<br>   “What's wrong with <b>the</b> inn?” said Frodo. “Tom Bombadil recommended <b>it</b>. I expect <b>it</b>'s homelike enough inside.”
<br>   Even from <b>the</b> outside <b>the</b> inn looked a pleasant house <b>to</b> familiar eyes. It had a front <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> two wings running back <b>on</b> land partly cut out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, so that at <b>the</b> rear <b>the</b> second-floor windows were level with <b>the</b> ground. There was a wide arch leading <b>to</b> a courtyard between <b>the</b> two wings, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left under <b>the</b> arch there was a large doorway reached <b>by</b> a few broad steps. The door was open <b>and</b> light streamed out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Above <b>the</b> arch there was a lamp, <b>and</b> beneath <b>it</b> swung a large signboard: a fat white pony reared up <b>on</b> its hind legs. Over <b>the</b> door was painted in white letters: <b>the</b> prancing pony <b>by</b> barliman butterbur. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.
<br>   As they hesitated outside in <b>the</b> gloom, someone began singing a merry song inside, <b>and</b> many cheerful voices joined loudly in <b>the</b> chorus. They listened <b>to</b> this encouraging sound for a moment <b>and</b> then got off their ponies. The song ended <b>and</b> there was a burst <b>of</b> laughter <b>and</b> clapping.
<br>   They led their ponies under <b>the</b> arch, <b>and</b> leaving them standing in <b>the</b> yard they climbed up <b>the</b> steps. Frodo went forward <b>and</b> nearly bumped <b>into</b> a short fat man with a bald head <b>and</b> a red face. He had a white apron <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> was bustling out <b>of</b> one door <b>and</b> in through another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs.
<br>   “Can we—” began Frodo.
<br>   “Half a minute, if you please!” shouted <b>the</b> man over his shoulder, <b>and</b> vanished <b>into</b> a babel <b>of</b> voices <b>and</b> a cloud <b>of</b> smoke. In a moment he was out again, wiping his hands <b>on</b> his apron.
<br>   “Good evening, little master!” he said, bending down. “What may you be wanting?”
<br>   “Beds for four, <b>and</b> stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. Are you Mr. Butterbur?”
<br>   “That's right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service! You're from <b>the</b> Shire, eh?” he said, <b>and</b> then suddenly he clapped his hand <b>to</b> his forehead, as if trying <b>to</b> remember something. “Hobbits!” he cried. “Now what does that remind me <b>of</b>? Might I ask your names, sir?”
<br>   “Mr. Took <b>and</b> Mr. Brandybuck,” said Frodo; “<b>and</b> this is Sam Gamgee. My name is Underhill.”
<br>   “There now!” said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. “It's gone again! But <b>it</b>'ll come back, when I have time <b>to</b> think. I'm run off my feet; <b>but</b> I'll see what I can do for you. We don't often get a party out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire nowadays, <b>and</b> I should be sorry not <b>to</b> make you welcome. But there is such a crowd already in <b>the</b> house tonight as there hasn't been for long enough. It never rains <b>but</b> <b>it</b> pours, we say in Bree.
<br>   “Hi! Nob!” he shouted. “Where are you, you woolly-footed slow-coach? Nob!”
<br>   “Coming, sir! Coming!” A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out <b>of</b> a door, <b>and</b> seeing <b>the</b> travellers, stopped short <b>and</b> stared at them with great interest.
<br>   “Where's Bob?” asked <b>the</b> landlord. “You don't know? Well find him! Double sharp! I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there's five ponies that have <b>to</b> be stabled. He must find room somehow.” Nob trotted off with a grin <b>and</b> a wink.
<br>   “Well, now, what was I going <b>to</b> say?” said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his forehead. “One thing drives out another, so <b>to</b> speak. I'm that busy tonight, my head is going round. There's a party that came up <b>the</b> Greenway from down South last night—<b>and</b> that was strange enough <b>to</b> begin with. Then there's a travelling company <b>of</b> dwarves going West come in this evening. And now there's you. If you weren't hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But we've got a room <b>or</b> two in <b>the</b> north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this place was built. On <b>the</b> ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows <b>and</b> all as they like <b>it</b>. I hope you'll be comfortable. You'll be wanting supper, I don't doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!”
<br>   He led them a short way down a passage, <b>and</b> opened a door. “Here is a nice little parlour!” he said. “I hope <b>it</b> will suit. Excuse me now. I'm that busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It's hard work for two legs, <b>but</b> I don't get thinner. I'll look in again later. If you want anything, ring <b>the</b> hand-bell, <b>and</b> Nob will come. If he don't come, ring <b>and</b> shout!”
<br>   Off he went at last, <b>and</b> left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable <b>of</b> an endless stream <b>of</b> talk, however busy he might be. They found themselves in a small <b>and</b> cosy room. There was a bit <b>of</b> bright fire burning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth, <b>and</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>it</b> were some low <b>and</b> comfortable chairs. There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> was a large hand-bell. But Nob, <b>the</b> hobbit servant, came bustling in long before they thought <b>of</b> ringing. He brought candles <b>and</b> a tray full <b>of</b> plates.
<br>   “Will you be wanting anything <b>to</b> drink, masters?” he asked. “And shall I show you <b>the</b> bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?”
<br>   They were washed <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> good deep mugs <b>of</b> beer when Mr. Butterbur <b>and</b> Nob came in again. In a twinkling <b>the</b> table was laid. There was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs <b>of</b> butter, <b>and</b> half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as <b>the</b> Shire could show, <b>and</b> homelike enough <b>to</b> dispel <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> Sam's misgivings (already much relieved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> excellence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beer).
<br>   The landlord hovered round for a link, <b>and</b> then prepared <b>to</b> leave them. “I don't know whether you would care <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> company, when you have supped,” he said, standing at <b>the</b> door. “Perhaps you would rather go <b>to</b> your beds. Still <b>the</b> company would be very pleased <b>to</b> welcome you, if you had a mind. We don't get Outsiders—travellers from <b>the</b> Shire, I should say, begging your pardon—often; <b>and</b> we like <b>to</b> hear a bit <b>of</b> news, <b>or</b> any story <b>or</b> song you may have in mind. But as you please! Ring <b>the</b> bell, if you lack anything!”
<br>   So refreshed <b>and</b> encouraged did they feel at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> their supper (about three quarters <b>of</b> an hour's steady going, not hindered <b>by</b> unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, <b>and</b> Sam decided <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> company. Merry said <b>it</b> would be too stuffy. “I shall sit here quietly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire for a bit, <b>and</b> perhaps go out later for a sniff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air. Mind your Ps <b>and</b> Qs, <b>and</b> don't forget that you are supposed <b>to</b> be escaping in secret, <b>and</b> are still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high-road <b>and</b> not very far from <b>the</b> Shire!”
<br>   “All right!” said Pippin. “Mind yourself! Don't get lost, <b>and</b> don't forget that <b>it</b> is safer indoors!”
<br>   The company was in <b>the</b> big common-room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inn. The gathering was large <b>and</b> mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light. This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for <b>the</b> three lamps hanging from <b>the</b> beams were dim, <b>and</b> half veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur was standing near <b>the</b> fire, talking <b>to</b> a couple <b>of</b> dwarves <b>and</b> one <b>or</b> two strange-looking men. On <b>the</b> benches were various folk: men <b>of</b> Bree, a collection <b>of</b> local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more dwarves, <b>and</b> other vague figures difficult <b>to</b> make out away in <b>the</b> shadows <b>and</b> comers.
<br>   As soon as <b>the</b> Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus <b>of</b> welcome from <b>the</b> Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that had come up <b>the</b> Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced <b>the</b> newcomers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were seldom sure who <b>the</b> names belonged <b>to</b>. The Men <b>of</b> Bree seemed all <b>to</b> have rather botanical (<b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool <b>and</b> Ferny (not <b>to</b> mention Butterbur). Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits had similar names. The Mugworts, for instance, seemed numerous. But most <b>of</b> them had natural names, such as Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, <b>and</b> Tunnelly, many <b>of</b> which were used in <b>the</b> Shire. There were several Underhills from Saddle, <b>and</b> as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo <b>to</b> their hearts as a long-lost cousin.
<br>   The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly <b>and</b> inquisitive, <b>and</b> Frodo soon found that some explanation <b>of</b> what he was doing would have <b>to</b> be given. He gave out that he was interested in history <b>and</b> geography (at which there was much wagging <b>of</b> heads, although neither <b>of</b> these words were much used in <b>the</b> Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking <b>of</b> writing a book (at which there was silent astonishment), <b>and</b> that he <b>and</b> his friends wanted <b>to</b> collect information about hobbits living outside <b>the</b> Shire, especially in <b>the</b> eastern lands.
<br>   At this a chorus <b>of</b> voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted <b>to</b> write a book, <b>and</b> had had many ears, he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given a whole list <b>of</b> names, beginning with “Old Barliman here”, <b>to</b> whom he could go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign <b>of</b> writing a book <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot, <b>the</b> hobbits returned <b>to</b> their questions about doings in <b>the</b> Shire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, <b>and</b> he soon found himself sitting alone in a comer, listening <b>and</b> looking around.
<br>   The Men <b>and</b> Dwarves were mostly talking <b>of</b> distant events <b>and</b> telling flews <b>of</b> a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away in <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed that <b>the</b> Men who had come up <b>the</b> Greenway were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The Bree-folk were sympathetic, <b>but</b> plainly not very ready <b>to</b> take a large number <b>of</b> strangers <b>into</b> their little land. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more <b>and</b> more people would be coming north in <b>the</b> near future. “If room isn't found for them, they'll find <b>it</b> for themselves. They've a right <b>to</b> live, same as other folk,” he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at <b>the</b> prospect.
<br>   The hobbits did not pay much attention <b>to</b> all this, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> did not at <b>the</b> moment seem <b>to</b> concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam <b>and</b> Pippin, who were now feeling quite at home, <b>and</b> were chatting gaily about events in <b>the</b> Shire. Pippin roused a good deal <b>of</b> laughter with an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, <b>the</b> Mayor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fattest hobbit in <b>the</b> Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, <b>and</b> came out like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-landers, who seemed <b>to</b> have been in <b>the</b> Shire several times, wanted <b>to</b> know where <b>the</b> Underhills lived <b>and</b> who they were related <b>to</b>.
<br>   Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, sitting in <b>the</b> shadows near <b>the</b> wall, was also listening intently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> was smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, showing high boots <b>of</b> supple leather that fitted him well, <b>but</b> had seen much wear <b>and</b> were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak <b>of</b> heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, <b>and</b> in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> gleam <b>of</b> his eyes could be seen as he watched <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Who is that?” Frodo asked, when he got a chance <b>to</b> whisper <b>to</b> Mr. Butterbur. “I don't think you introduced him?”
<br>   “Him?” said <b>the</b> landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye without turning his head. “I don't rightly know. He is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wandering folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not <b>but</b> what he can tell a rare tale when he has <b>the</b> mind. He disappears for a month, <b>or</b> a year, <b>and</b> then he pops up again. He was in <b>and</b> out pretty often last spring; <b>but</b> I haven't seen him about lately. What his right name is I've never heard: <b>but</b> he's known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace <b>on</b> his long shanks; though he don't tell nobody what cause he has <b>to</b> hurry. But there's <b>no</b> accounting for East <b>and</b> West, as we say in Bree, meaning <b>the</b> Rangers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.” But at that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away <b>by</b> a demand for more ale <b>and</b> his last remark remained unexplained.
<br>   Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard <b>or</b> guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave <b>of</b> his hand <b>and</b> a nod, he invited Frodo <b>to</b> come over <b>and</b> sit <b>by</b> him. As Frodo drew near be threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head <b>of</b> dark hair necked with grey, <b>and</b> in a pale stem face a pair <b>of</b> keen grey eyes.
<br>   “I am called Strider,” he said in a low voice. “I am very pleased <b>to</b> meet you. Master—Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.”
<br>   “He did,” said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under <b>the</b> stare <b>of</b> those keen eyes.
<br>   “Well, Master Underhill,” said Strider, “if I were you, I should stop your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, <b>and</b> chance-meeting are pleasant enough, <b>but</b>, well—this isn't <b>the</b> Shire. There are queer folk about. Though I say <b>it</b> as shouldn't, you may think,” he added with a wry smile, seeing Frodo's glance. “And there have been even stranger travellers through Bree lately,” he went <b>on</b>, watching Frodo's face.
<br>   Frodo returned his gaze <b>but</b> said nothing; <b>and</b> Strider made <b>no</b> further sign. His attention seemed suddenly <b>to</b> be fixed <b>on</b> Pippin. To his alarm Frodo became aware that <b>the</b> ridiculous young Took, encouraged <b>by</b> his success with <b>the</b> fat Mayor <b>of</b> Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic account <b>of</b> Bilbo's farewell party. He was already giving an imitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Speech, <b>and</b> was drawing near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> astonishing Disappearance.
<br>   Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local hobbits, <b>no</b> doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond <b>the</b> River; <b>but</b> some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing <b>or</b> two, <b>and</b> had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins <b>to</b> their minds, especially if there had been inquiries in Bree after that name.
<br>   Frodo fidgeted, wondering what <b>to</b> do. Pippin was evidently much enjoying <b>the</b> attention he was getting, <b>and</b> had become quite forgetful <b>of</b> their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention <b>the</b> Ring; <b>and</b> that might well be disastrous.
<br>   “You had better do something quick!” whispered Strider in his ear.
<br>   Frodo jumped up <b>and</b> stood <b>on</b> a table, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> talk. The attention <b>of</b> Pippin's audience was disturbed. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits looked at Frodo <b>and</b> laughed <b>and</b> clapped, thinking that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him.
<br>   Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, <b>and</b> found himself (as was his habit when making a speech) fingering <b>the</b> things in his pocket. He felt <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b> its chain, <b>and</b> quite unaccountably <b>the</b> desire came over him <b>to</b> slip <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> vanish out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silly situation. It seemed <b>to</b> him, somehow, as if me suggestion came <b>to</b> him from outside, from someone <b>or</b> something a <b>the</b> room. He resisted <b>the</b> temptation firmly, <b>and</b> clasped <b>the</b> Ring in his hand, as if <b>to</b> keep a hold <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> prevent <b>it</b> from escaping <b>or</b> doing any mischief. At any rate <b>it</b> gave him <b>no</b> inspiration. He spoke “a few suitable words”, as they would have said in <b>the</b> Shire: We are all very much gratified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> kindness <b>of</b> your reception, <b>and</b> I venture <b>to</b> hope that my brief visit will help <b>to</b> renew <b>the</b> old ties <b>of</b> friendship between <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> Bree; <b>and</b> then he hesitated <b>and</b> coughed.
<br>   Everyone in <b>the</b> room was now looking at him. “A song!” shouted one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “A song! A song!” shouted all <b>the</b> others. “Come <b>on</b> now, master, sing us something that we haven't heard before!”
<br>   For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond <b>of</b> (<b>and</b> indeed rather proud <b>of</b>, for he had made up <b>the</b> words himself). It was about an inn; <b>and</b> that is probably why <b>it</b> came <b>into</b> Frodo's mind just then. Here <b>it</b> is in full. Only a few words <b>of</b> <b>it</b> are now, as a rule, remembered.
<br>   
<br>There is an inn, a merry old inn
<br>beneath an old grey hill,
<br>And there they brew a beer so brown
<br>That <b>the</b> Man in <b>the</b> Moon himself came down
<br>one night <b>to</b> drink his fill.
<br>
<br>The ostler has a tipsy cat
<br>that plays a five-stringed fiddle;
<br>And up <b>and</b> down he runs his bow,
<br>Now squeaking high, now purring low,
<br>now sawing in <b>the</b> middle.
<br>
<br>The landlord keeps a little dog
<br>that is mighty fond <b>of</b> jokes;
<br>When there's good cheer among <b>the</b> guests,
<br>He cocks an ear at all <b>the</b> jests
<br><b>and</b> laughs until he chokes.
<br>
<br>They also keep a horned cow
<br>as proud as any queen;
<br>But music turns her head like ale,
<br>And makes her wave her tufted tail
<br><b>and</b> dance upon <b>the</b> green.
<br>
<br>And O! <b>the</b> rows <b>of</b> silver dishes
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> store <b>of</b> silver spoons!
<br>For Sunday* there's a special pair,
<br>And these they polish up with care
<br><b>on</b> Saturday afternoons.
<br>					
<br>The Man in <b>the</b> Moon was drinking deep,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> cat began <b>to</b> wail;
<br>A dish <b>and</b> a spoon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table danced,
<br>The cow in <b>the</b> garden madly pranced,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> little dog chased his tail.
<br>
<br>The Man in <b>the</b> Moon took another mug,
<br><b>and</b> then rolled beneath his chair;
<br>And there he dozed <b>and</b> dreamed <b>of</b> ale,
<br>Till in <b>the</b> sky <b>the</b> stars were pale,
<br><b>and</b> dawn was in <b>the</b> air.
<br>
<br>Then <b>the</b> ostler said <b>to</b> his tipsy cat:
<br>“The white horses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon,
<br>They neigh <b>and</b> champ their silver bits;
<br>But their master's been <b>and</b> drowned his wits,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun'll be rising soon!’
<br>
<br>So <b>the</b> cat <b>on</b> his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,
<br>a jig that would wake <b>the</b> dead:
<br>He squeaked <b>and</b> sawed <b>and</b> quickened <b>the</b> tune,
<br>While <b>the</b> landlord shook <b>the</b> Man in <b>the</b> Moon:
<br>“It's after three!” he said.
<br>
<br>They rolled <b>the</b> Man slowly up <b>the</b> hill
<br><b>and</b> bundled him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Moon,
<br>While his horses galloped up in rear,
<br>And <b>the</b> cow came capering like a deer,
<br><b>and</b> a dish ran up with <b>the</b> spoon.
<br>
<br>Now quicker <b>the</b> fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;
<br><b>the</b> dog began <b>to</b> roar,
<br>The cow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> horses stood <b>on</b> their heads;
<br>The guests all bounded from their beds
<br><b>and</b> danced upon <b>the</b> floor.
<br>
<br>With a ping <b>and</b> a pong <b>the</b> fiddle-strings broke!
<br><b>the</b> cow jumped over <b>the</b> Moon,
<br>And <b>the</b> little dog laughed <b>to</b> see such fun,
<br>And <b>the</b> Saturday dish went off at a run
<br>with <b>the</b> silver Sunday spoon.
<br>
<br>The round Moon rolled behind <b>the</b> hill
<br>as <b>the</b> Sun raised up her head.
<br>She** hardly believed her fiery eyes;
<br>For though <b>it</b> was day, <b>to</b> her surprise
<br>they all went back <b>to</b> bed!
<br>
<br>   There was loud <b>and</b> long applause. Frodo had a good voice, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> song tickled their fancy. “Where's old Barley?” they cried. “He ought <b>to</b> hear this. Bob ought <b>to</b> learn his cat <b>the</b> fiddle, <b>and</b> then we'd have a dance.” They called for more ale, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> shout: “Let's have <b>it</b> again, master! Come <b>on</b> now! Once more!”
<br>   They made Frodo have another drink, <b>and</b> then begin his song again, while many <b>of</b> them joined in; for <b>the</b> tune was well known, <b>and</b> they were quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo's turn <b>to</b> feel pleased with himself. He capered about <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> when he came a second time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cow jumped over <b>the</b> Moon, he leaped in <b>the</b> air. Much too vigorously; for he came down, bang, <b>into</b> a tray full <b>of</b> mugs, <b>and</b> slipped, <b>and</b> rolled off <b>the</b> table with a crash, clatter, <b>and</b> bump! The audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter, <b>and</b> stopped short a gaping silence; for <b>the</b> singer disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through <b>the</b> floor without leaving a hole!
<br>   The local hobbits stared in amazement, <b>and</b> then sprang <b>to</b> their feet <b>and</b> shouted for Barliman. All <b>the</b> company drew away from Pippin <b>and</b> Sam, who found themselves left alone in a comer, <b>and</b> eyed darkly <b>and</b> doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as <b>the</b> companions <b>of</b> a travelling magician <b>of</b> unknown powers <b>and</b> purpose. But there was one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing <b>and</b> half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he slipped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> squint-eyed southerner: <b>the</b> two had been whispering together a good deal during <b>the</b> evening. Harry <b>the</b> gatekeeper also went out just behind them..
<br>   Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else <b>to</b> do, he crawled away under <b>the</b> tables <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark comer <b>by</b> Strider, who sat unmoved, giving <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> took off <b>the</b> Ring. How <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> be <b>on</b> his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he had been handling <b>it</b> in his pocket while he sang, <b>and</b> that somehow <b>it</b> had slipped <b>on</b> when he stuck out his hand with a jerk <b>to</b> save his fall. For a moment he wondered if <b>the</b> Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps <b>it</b> had tried <b>to</b> reveal itself in response <b>to</b> some wish <b>or</b> command that was felt in <b>the</b> room. He did not like <b>the</b> looks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men that had gone out.
<br>   “Well?” said Strider, when he reappeared. “Why did you do that? Worse than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in <b>it</b>! Or should I say your finger?”
<br>   “I don't know what you mean,” said Frodo, annoyed <b>and</b> alarmed.
<br>   “Oh yes, you do,” answered Strider; “<b>but</b> we had better wait until <b>the</b> uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I should like a quiet word with you.”
<br>   “What about?” asked Frodo, ignoring <b>the</b> sudden use <b>of</b> his proper name.
<br>   “A matter <b>of</b> some importance—<b>to</b> us both,” answered Strider, looking Frodo in <b>the</b> eye. “You may hear something <b>to</b> your advantage.”
<br>   “Very well,” said Frodo, trying <b>to</b> appear unconcerned. “I'll talk <b>to</b> you later.”
<br>   Meanwhile an argument was going <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had come trotting in, <b>and</b> he was now trying <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> several conflicting accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event at <b>the</b> same time.
<br>   “I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,” said a hobbit; “<b>or</b> leastways I didn't see him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished <b>into</b> thin air, in a manner <b>of</b> speaking.”
<br>   “You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!” said <b>the</b> landlord, looking puzzled.
<br>   “Yes I do!” replied Mugwort. “And I mean what I say, what's more.”
<br>   “There's some mistake somewhere,” said Butterbur, shaking his head. There was too much <b>of</b> that Mr. Underhill <b>to</b> go vanishing <b>into</b> thin air; <b>or</b> <b>into</b> thick air, as is more likely in this room.”
<br>   “Well, where is he now?” cried several voices.
<br>   “How should I know? He's welcome <b>to</b> go where he will, so long as he pays in <b>the</b> morning. There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.”
<br>   “Well, I saw what I saw, <b>and</b> I saw what I didn't,” said Mugwort obstinately.
<br>   “And I say there's some mistake,” repeated Butterbur, picking up <b>the</b> tray <b>and</b> gathering up <b>the</b> broken crockery.
<br>   “Of course there's a mistake!” said Frodo. “I haven't vanished. Here I am! I've just been having a few words with Strider in <b>the</b> comer.”
<br>   He came forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> firelight; <b>but</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company backed away,, even more perturbed than before. They were not in <b>the</b> least satisfied <b>by</b> his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under <b>the</b> tables after he had fallen. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Bree went off then <b>and</b> there in a huff, having <b>no</b> fancy for further entertainment that evening. One <b>or</b> two gave Frodo a black look <b>and</b> departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two <b>or</b> three strange Men that still remained got up <b>and</b> said good night <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landlord, <b>but</b> not <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> his friends. Before long <b>no</b> one was left <b>but</b> Strider, who sat <b>on</b>, unnoticed, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wall.
<br>   Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably, that his house would be full again <b>on</b> many future nights, until <b>the</b> present mystery had been thoroughly discussed. “Now what have you been doing, Mr. Underhill?” he asked. “Frightening my customers <b>and</b> breaking up my crocks with your acrobatics!”
<br>   “I am very sorry <b>to</b> have caused any trouble,” said Frodo. “It was quite unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.”
<br>   “All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going <b>to</b> do any more tumbling, <b>or</b> conjuring, <b>or</b> whatever <b>it</b> was, you'd best warn folk beforehand—<b>and</b> warn me. We're a bit suspicious round here <b>of</b> anything out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way -uncanny, if you understand me; <b>and</b> we don't take <b>to</b> <b>it</b> all <b>of</b> a sudden.”
<br>   “I shan't be doing anything <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise you. And now I think I'll be getting <b>to</b> bed. We shall be making an early start. Will you see that our ponies are ready <b>by</b> eight o'clock?”
<br>   “Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back <b>to</b> my mind that I ought <b>to</b> tell you. I hope that you'll not take <b>it</b> amiss. When I've seen <b>to</b> a thing <b>or</b> two, I'll come along <b>to</b> your room, if you're willing.”
<br>   “Certainly!” said Frodo; <b>but</b> his heart sank. He wondered how many private talks he would have before he got <b>to</b> bed, <b>and</b> what they would reveal. Were these people all in league against him? He began <b>to</b> suspect even old Butterbur's fat face <b>of</b> concealing dark designs.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>STRIDER
<br>
<br>   Frodo, Pippin, <b>and</b> Sam made their way back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parlour. There was <b>no</b> light. Merry was not there, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire had burned low. It was not until they had puffed up <b>the</b> embers <b>into</b> a blaze <b>and</b> thrown <b>on</b> a couple <b>of</b> faggots that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting in a chair <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door!
<br>   “Hallo!” said Pippin. “Who are you, <b>and</b> what do you want?”
<br>   “I am called Strider,” he answered: “<b>and</b> though he may have forgotten <b>it</b>, your friend promised <b>to</b> have a quiet talk with me.”
<br>   “You said I might hear something <b>to</b> my advantage, I believe,” said Frodo. “What have you <b>to</b> say?”
<br>   “Several things,” answered Strider. “But, <b>of</b> course, I have my price.”
<br>   “What do you mean?” asked Frodo sharply.
<br>   “Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, <b>and</b> give you some good advice—<b>but</b> I shall want a reward.”
<br>   “And what will that be, pray?” said Frodo. He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal, <b>and</b> he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him. All <b>of</b> <b>it</b> would hardly satisfy a rogue, <b>and</b> he could not spare any <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>   “No more than you can afford,” answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. “Just this: you must take me along with you, until I wish <b>to</b> leave you.”
<br>   “Oh, indeed!” replied Frodo, surprised, <b>but</b> not much relieved. “Even if I wanted another companion, I should not agree <b>to</b> any such thing, until I knew a good deal more about you, <b>and</b> your business.”
<br>   “Excellent!” exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs <b>and</b> sitting back comfortably. “You seem <b>to</b> be coming <b>to</b> your senses again, <b>and</b> that is all <b>to</b> <b>the</b> good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you what I know, <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> reward <b>to</b> you. You may be glad <b>to</b> grant <b>it</b>, when you have heard me.”
<br>   “Go <b>on</b> then!” said Frodo. “What do you know?”
<br>   “Too much; too many dark things,” said Strider grimly. “But as for your business—” He got up <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, opened <b>it</b> quickly <b>and</b> looked out. Then he shut <b>it</b> quietly <b>and</b> sat down again. “I have quick ears,” he went <b>on</b>, lowering his voice, “<b>and</b> though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild <b>and</b> wary things <b>and</b> I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now, I was behind <b>the</b> hedge this evening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road west <b>of</b> Bree, when four hobbits came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said <b>to</b> old Bombadil <b>or</b> <b>to</b> one another, <b>but</b> one thing interested me. Please remember, said one <b>of</b> them, that <b>the</b> name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over <b>the</b> gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; <b>but</b> if so, I should advise him <b>and</b> his friends <b>to</b> be more careful.”
<br>   “I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,” said Frodo angrily, “<b>and</b> I have still <b>to</b> learn why <b>it</b> interests you. Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying <b>and</b> eavesdropping; <b>but</b> if so, I should advise him <b>to</b> explain <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Well answered!” said Strider laughing. “But <b>the</b> explanation is simple:
<br>   I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted <b>to</b> find him quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, well, a secret that concerned me <b>and</b> my friends.
<br>   “Now, don't mistake me!” he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, <b>and</b> Sam jumped up with a scowl. “I shall take more care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret than you do. And care is needed!” He leaned forward <b>and</b> looked at them. “Watch every shadow!” he said in a low voice. “Black horsemen have passed through Bree. On Monday one came down <b>the</b> Greenway, they say; <b>and</b> another appeared later, coming up <b>the</b> Greenway from <b>the</b> south.”
<br>   There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke <b>to</b> Pippin <b>and</b> Sam: “I ought <b>to</b> have guessed <b>it</b> from <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> gatekeeper greeted us,” he said. “And <b>the</b> landlord seems <b>to</b> have heard something. Why did he press us <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> company? And why <b>on</b> earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought <b>to</b> have stayed quiet in here.”
<br>   “It would have been better,” said Strider. “I would have stopped your going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> common-room, if I could; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> innkeeper would not let me in <b>to</b> see you, <b>or</b> take a message.”
<br>   “Do you think he—” began Frodo.
<br>   “No, I don't think any harm <b>of</b> old Butterbur. Only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds <b>of</b> my sort.” Frodo gave him a puzzled look. “Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?” said Strider with a curl <b>of</b> his lip <b>and</b> a queer gleam in his eye. “But I hope we shall get <b>to</b> know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your song. For that little prank—”
<br>   “It was sheer accident!” interrupted Frodo.
<br>   “I wonder,” said Strider. “Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous.”
<br>   “Hardly more than <b>it</b> was already,” said Frodo. “I knew these horsemen were pursuing me; <b>but</b> now at any rate they seem <b>to</b> have missed me <b>and</b> <b>to</b> have gone away.”
<br>   “You must not count <b>on</b> that!” said Strider sharply. “They will return. And more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these Riders.” He paused, <b>and</b> his eyes were cold <b>and</b> hard. “And there are some folk in Bree who are not <b>to</b> be trusted,” he went <b>on</b>. “Bill Ferny, for instance. He has an evil name in <b>the</b> Bree-land, <b>and</b> queer folk call at his house. You must have noticed him among <b>the</b> company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He was very close with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern strangers, <b>and</b> they slipped out together just after your “accident". Not all <b>of</b> those Southerners mean well; <b>and</b> as for Ferny, he would sell anything <b>to</b> anybody; <b>or</b> make mischief for amusement.”
<br>   “What will Ferny sell, <b>and</b> what has my accident got <b>to</b> do with him?” said Frodo, still determined not <b>to</b> understand Strider's hints.
<br>   “News <b>of</b> you, <b>of</b> course,” answered Strider. “An account <b>of</b> your performance would be very interesting <b>to</b> certain people. After that they would hardly need <b>to</b> be told your real name. It seems <b>to</b> me only too likely that they will hear <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before this night is over. Is that enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide <b>or</b> not. But I may say that I know all <b>the</b> lands between <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might prove useful. You will have <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> open road after tonight; for <b>the</b> horsemen will watch <b>it</b> night <b>and</b> day. You may escape from Bree, <b>and</b> be allowed <b>to</b> go forward while <b>the</b> Sun is up; <b>but</b> you won't go far. They will come <b>on</b> you in <b>the</b> wild, in some dark place where there is <b>no</b> help. Do you wish them <b>to</b> find you? They are terrible!”
<br>   The hobbits looked at him, <b>and</b> saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain, <b>and</b> his hands clenched <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> his chair. The room was very quiet <b>and</b> still, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light seemed <b>to</b> have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory <b>or</b> listening <b>to</b> sounds in <b>the</b> Night far away.
<br>   “There!” he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. “Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, <b>but</b> you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have <b>to</b> escape, if you can. Strider can take you <b>by</b> paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have him?”
<br>   There was a heavy silence. Frodo made <b>no</b> answer, his mind was confused with doubt <b>and</b> fear. Sam frowned, <b>and</b> looked at his master; <b>and</b> at last he broke out:
<br>   “With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say <b>no</b>! This Strider here, he warns <b>and</b> he says take care; <b>and</b> I say yes <b>to</b> that, <b>and</b> let's begin with him. He comes out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wild, <b>and</b> I never heard <b>no</b> good <b>of</b> such folk. He knows something, that's plain, <b>and</b> more than I like; <b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> reason why we should let him go leading us out <b>into</b> some dark place far from help, as he puts <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Pippin fidgeted <b>and</b> looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply <b>to</b> Sam, <b>but</b> turned his keen eyes <b>on</b> Frodo. Frodo caught his glance <b>and</b> looked away. “No,” he said slowly. “I don't agree. I think, I think you are not really as you choose <b>to</b> look. You began <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> me like <b>the</b> Bree-folk, <b>but</b> your voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should warn us <b>to</b> take care, <b>and</b> yet ask us <b>to</b> take you <b>on</b> trust. Why <b>the</b> disguise? Who are you? What do you really know about—about my business; <b>and</b> how do you know <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “The lesson in caution has been well learned,” said Strider with a grim smile. “But caution is one thing <b>and</b> wavering is another. You will never get <b>to</b> Rivendell now <b>on</b> your own, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> trust me is your only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answer some <b>of</b> your questions, if that will help you <b>to</b> do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Still here <b>it</b> is—”
<br>   At that moment there came a knock at <b>the</b> door. Mr. Butterbur had arrived with candles, <b>and</b> behind him was Nob with cans <b>of</b> hot water. Strider withdrew <b>into</b> a dark corner.
<br>   “I've come <b>to</b> bid you good night,” said <b>the</b> landlord, putting <b>the</b> candles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. “Nob! Take <b>the</b> water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rooms!” He came in <b>and</b> shut <b>the</b> door.
<br>   “It's like this,” he began, hesitating <b>and</b> looking troubled. “If I've done any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll admit; <b>and</b> I'm a busy man. But first one thing <b>and</b> then another this week have jogged my memory, as <b>the</b> saying goes; <b>and</b> not too late I hope. You see, I was asked <b>to</b> look out for hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> for one <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins in particular.”
<br>   “And what has that got <b>to</b> do with me?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “Ah! you know best,” said <b>the</b> landlord, knowingly. “I won't give you away; <b>but</b> I was told that this Baggins would be going <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Underhill, <b>and</b> I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may say so.”
<br>   “Indeed! Let's have <b>it</b> then!” said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.
<br>   “A stout little fellow with red cheeks,” said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, <b>but</b> Sam looked indignant. “That won't help you much; <b>it</b> goes for most hobbits. Barley, he says <b>to</b> me,” continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. “But this one is taller than some <b>and</b> fairer than most, <b>and</b> he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your pardon, <b>but</b> he said <b>it</b>, not me.”
<br>   “He said <b>it</b>? And who was he?” asked Frodo eagerly.
<br>   “Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, <b>but</b> he's a good friend <b>of</b> mine, whether <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. But now I don't know what he'll have <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour <b>or</b> me <b>into</b> a block <b>of</b> wood, I shouldn't wonder. He's a bit hasty. Still what's done can't be undone.”
<br>   “Well, what have you done?” said Frodo, getting impatient with <b>the</b> slow unravelling <b>of</b> Butterbur's thoughts.
<br>   “Where was I?” said <b>the</b> landlord, pausing <b>and</b> snapping his fingers. “Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right <b>into</b> my room without a knock. Barley, he says, I'm off in <b>the</b> morning. Will you do something for me? You've only <b>to</b> name <b>it</b>, I said. I'm in a hurry, said he, <b>and</b> I've <b>no</b> time myself, <b>but</b> I want a message took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Have you anyone you can send, <b>and</b> trust <b>to</b> go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow, maybe, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> day after. Make <b>it</b> tomorrow, he says, <b>and</b> then he gave me a letter.
<br>   “It's addressed plain enough,” said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter from his pocket, <b>and</b> reading out <b>the</b> address slowly <b>and</b> proudly (he valued his reputation as a lettered man):
<br>   
<br>   Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in <b>the</b> SHIRE.
<br>   
<br>   “A letter for me from Gandalf!” cried Frodo.
<br>   “Ah!” said Mr. Butterbur. “Then your right name is Baggins?”
<br>   “It is,” said Frodo, “<b>and</b> you had better give me that letter at once, <b>and</b> explain why you never sent <b>it</b>. That's what you came <b>to</b> tell me, I suppose, though you've taken a long time <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point.”
<br>   Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. “You're right, master,” he said, “<b>and</b> I beg your pardon. And I'm mortal afraid <b>of</b> what Gandalf will say, if harm comes <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. But I didn't keep <b>it</b> back a-purpose. I put <b>it</b> <b>by</b> safe. Then I couldn't find nobody willing <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire next day, nor <b>the</b> day after, <b>and</b> none <b>of</b> my own folk were <b>to</b> spare; <b>and</b> then one thing after another drove <b>it</b> out <b>of</b> my mind. I'm a busy man. I'll do what I can <b>to</b> set matters right, <b>and</b> if there's any help I can give, you've only <b>to</b> name <b>it</b>.
<br>   
<br>   “Leaving <b>the</b> letter aside, I promised Gandalf <b>no</b> less. Barley, he says <b>to</b> me, this friend <b>of</b> mine from <b>the</b> Shire, he may be coming out this way before long, him <b>and</b> another. He'll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that! But you need ask <b>no</b> questions. And if I'm not with him, he may be in trouble, <b>and</b> he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, <b>and</b> I'll be grateful, he says. And here you are, <b>and</b> trouble is not far off, seemingly.”
<br>   
<br>   “What do you mean?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “These black men,” said <b>the</b> landlord lowering his voice. “They're looking for Baggins, <b>and</b> if they mean well, then I'm a hobbit. It was <b>on</b> Monday, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> dogs were yammering <b>and</b> <b>the</b> geese screaming. Uncanny, I called <b>it</b>. Nob, he came <b>and</b> told me that two black men were at <b>the</b> door asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair was all stood <b>on</b> end. I bid <b>the</b> black fellows be off, <b>and</b> slammed <b>the</b> door <b>on</b> them; <b>but</b> they've been asking <b>the</b> same question all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he's been asking questions, too. Tried <b>to</b> get in here <b>to</b> see you, before you'd had bite <b>or</b> sup, he did.”
<br>   “He did!” said Strider suddenly, coming forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> light. “And much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.”
<br>   The landlord jumped with surprise. “You!” he cried. “You're always popping up. What do you want now?”
<br>   “He's here with my leave,” said Frodo. “He came <b>to</b> offer me his help.”
<br>   “Well, you know your own business, maybe,” said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously at Strider. “But if I was in your plight, I wouldn't take up with a Ranger.”
<br>   “Then who would you take up with?” asked Strider. “A fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because people shout <b>it</b> at him all day? They cannot stay in The Pony for ever, <b>and</b> they cannot go home. They have a long road before them. Will you go with them <b>and</b> keep <b>the</b> black men off?”
<br>   “Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn't do that for any money,” said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared. “But why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr. Underhill? What are all these queer goings <b>on</b>? What are these black men after, <b>and</b> where do they come from, I'd like <b>to</b> know?”
<br>   “I'm sorry I can't explain <b>it</b> all,” answered Frodo. “I am tired <b>and</b> very worried, <b>and</b> <b>it</b>'s a long tale. But if you mean <b>to</b> help me, I ought <b>to</b> warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These Black Riders: I am not sure, <b>but</b> I think, I fear they come from—”
<br>   “They come from Mordor,” said Strider in a low voice. “From Mordor, Barliman, if that means anything <b>to</b> you.”
<br>   “Save us!” cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; <b>the</b> name evidently was known <b>to</b> him. “That is <b>the</b> worst news that has come <b>to</b> Bree in my time.” “It is,” said Frodo. “Are you still willing <b>to</b> help me?” “I am,” said Mr. Butterbur. “More than ever. Though I don't know what <b>the</b> likes <b>of</b> me can do against, against—” he faltered.
<br>   “Against <b>the</b> Shadow in <b>the</b> East,” said Strider quietly. “Not much, Barliman, <b>but</b> every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here tonight, as Mr. Underhill, <b>and</b> you can forget <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins, till he is far away.”
<br>   “I'll do that,” said Butterbur. “But they'll find out he's here without help from me, I'm afraid. It's a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention <b>to</b> himself this evening, <b>to</b> say <b>no</b> more. The story <b>of</b> that Mr. Bilbo's going off has been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in his slow pate: <b>and</b> there are others in Bree quicker in <b>the</b> uptake than he is.”
<br>   “Well, we can only hope <b>the</b> Riders won't come back yet,” said Frodo.
<br>   “I hope not, indeed,” said Butterbur. “But spooks <b>or</b> <b>no</b> spooks, they won't get in The Pony so easy. Don't you worry till <b>the</b> morning. Nob'll say <b>no</b> word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand <b>on</b> my legs. Me <b>and</b> my folk'll keep watch tonight; <b>but</b> you had best get some sleep, if you can.”
<br>   “In any case we must be called at dawn,” said Frodo. “We must get off as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.”
<br>   “Right! I'll see <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orders,” said <b>the</b> landlord. “Good night, Mr. Baggins—Underhill, I should say! Good night—now, bless me! Where's your Mr. Brandybuck?”
<br>   “I don't know,” said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all about Merry, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was getting late. “I am afraid he is out. He said something about going for a breath <b>of</b> air.”
<br>   “Well, you do want looking after <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake: your party might be <b>on</b> a holiday!” said Butterbur. “I must go <b>and</b> bar <b>the</b> doors quick, <b>but</b> I'll see your friend is let in when he comes. I'd better send Nob <b>to</b> look for him. Good night <b>to</b> you all!” At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another doubtful look at Strider <b>and</b> a shake <b>of</b> his head. His footsteps retreated down <b>the</b> passage.
<br>   “Well?” said Strider. “When are you going <b>to</b> open that letter?” Frodo looked carefully at <b>the</b> seal before he broke <b>it</b>. It seemed certainly <b>to</b> be Gandalf's. Inside, written in <b>the</b> wizard's strong <b>but</b> graceful script, was <b>the</b> following message:
<br>   
<br>   THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear's Day, Shire Year, 1418.
<br>   Dear Frodo,
<br>   Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End soon, <b>and</b> get out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> July at latest. I will return as soon as I can; <b>and</b> I will follow you, if I find that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust <b>the</b> landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend <b>of</b> mine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, <b>by</b> some called Strider. He knows our business <b>and</b> will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I do not come, Elrond will advise you.
<br>   Yours in haste
<br>   GANDALF. 
<br>   PS. Do NOT use It again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel <b>by</b> night! 
<br>   PPS. Make sure that <b>it</b> is <b>the</b> real Strider. There are many strange men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads. His true name is Aragorn. 
<br>All that is gold does not glitter,
<br>Not all those who wander are lost;
<br>The old that is strong does not wither,
<br>Deep roots are not reached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> frost.
<br>From <b>the</b> ashes a fire shall be woken,
<br>A light from <b>the</b> shadows shall spring;
<br>Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
<br>The crownless again shall be king.
<br>   
<br>   
<br>   PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, <b>but</b> his memory is like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I shall roast him.
<br>   Fare Well!
<br>   
<br>   Frodo read <b>the</b> letter <b>to</b> himself, <b>and</b> then passed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Pippin <b>and</b> Sam. “Really old Butterbur has made a mess <b>of</b> things!” he said. “He deserves roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in Rivendell <b>by</b> now. But what can have happened <b>to</b> Gandalf? He writes as if he was going <b>into</b> great danger.”
<br>   “He has been doing that for many years,” said Strider.
<br>   Frodo turned <b>and</b> looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's second postscript. “Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at once?” he asked. “It would have saved time.”
<br>   “Would <b>it</b>? Would any <b>of</b> you have believed me till now?” said Strider. “I knew nothing <b>of</b> this letter. For all I knew I had <b>to</b> persuade you <b>to</b> trust me without proofs, if I was <b>to</b> help you. In any case, I did not intend <b>to</b> tell you all about myself at once. I had <b>to</b> study you first, <b>and</b> make sure <b>of</b> you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had made up my mind, I was ready <b>to</b> tell you whatever you asked. But I must admit,” he added with a queer laugh, “that I hoped you would take <b>to</b> me for my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies <b>of</b> distrust <b>and</b> longs for friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.”
<br>   “They are—at first sight at any rate,” laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf's letter. “But handsome is as handsome does, as we say in <b>the</b> Shire; <b>and</b> I daresay we shall all look much <b>the</b> same after lying for days in hedges <b>and</b> ditches.”
<br>   “It would take more than a few days, <b>or</b> weeks, <b>or</b> years, <b>of</b> wandering in <b>the</b> Wild <b>to</b> make you look like Strider,” he answered. “And you would die first, unless you are made <b>of</b> sterner stuff than you look <b>to</b> be.”
<br>   Pippin subsided; <b>but</b> Sam was not daunted, <b>and</b> he still eyed Strider dubiously. “How do we know you are <b>the</b> Strider that Gandalf speaks about?” he demanded. “You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying <b>to</b> get us <b>to</b> go with you. You might have done in <b>the</b> real Strider <b>and</b> took his clothes. What have you <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> that?”
<br>   “That you are a stout fellow,” answered Strider; “<b>but</b> I am afraid my only answer <b>to</b> you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed <b>the</b> real Strider, I could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk. If I was after <b>the</b> Ring, I could have <b>it</b>—NOW!”
<br>   He stood up, <b>and</b> seemed suddenly <b>to</b> grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a light, keen <b>and</b> commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> a sword that had hung concealed <b>by</b> his side. They did not dare <b>to</b> move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.
<br>   “But I am <b>the</b> real Strider, fortunately,” he said, looking down at them with his face softened <b>by</b> a sudden smile. “I am Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn; <b>and</b> if <b>by</b> life <b>or</b> death I can save you, I will.”
<br>   There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. “I believed that you were a friend before <b>the</b> letter came,” he said, “<b>or</b> at least I wished <b>to</b>. You have frightened me several times tonight, <b>but</b> never in <b>the</b> way that servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy would, <b>or</b> so I imagine. I think one <b>of</b> his spies would—well, seem fairer <b>and</b> feel fouler, if you understand.”
<br>   “I see,” laughed Strider. “I look foul <b>and</b> feel fair. Is that <b>it</b>? All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.”
<br>   “Did <b>the</b> verses apply <b>to</b> you then?” asked Frodo. “I could not make out what they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “I did not know,” he answered. “But I am Aragorn, <b>and</b> those verses go with that name.” He drew out his sword, <b>and</b> they saw that <b>the</b> blade was indeed broken a foot below <b>the</b> hilt. “Not much use is <b>it</b>, Sam?” said Strider. “But <b>the</b> time is near when <b>it</b> shall be forged anew.”
<br>   Sam said nothing.
<br>   “Well,” said Strider, “with Sam's permission we will call that settled. Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed <b>to</b> leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now <b>to</b> leave <b>it</b> unnoticed. But I shall try <b>to</b> get lost as soon as possible. I know one <b>or</b> two ways out <b>of</b> Bree-land other than <b>the</b> main road. If once we shake off <b>the</b> pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.”
<br>   “Weathertop?” said Sam. “What's that?”
<br>   “It is a hill, just <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, about half way from here <b>to</b> Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; <b>and</b> there we shall have a chance <b>to</b> look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, <b>and</b> we shall have <b>to</b> choose between various dangers.”
<br>   “When did you last see Gandalf?” asked Frodo. “Do you know where he is, <b>or</b> what he is doing?”
<br>   Strider looked grave. “I do not know,” he said. “I came west with him in <b>the</b> spring. I have often kept watch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire in <b>the</b> last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left <b>it</b> unguarded. We last met <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> May: at Sam Ford down <b>the</b> Brandywine. He told me that his business with you had gone well, <b>and</b> that you would be starting for Rivendell in <b>the</b> last week <b>of</b> September. As I knew he was at your side, I went away <b>on</b> a journey <b>of</b> my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reached him, <b>and</b> I was not at hand <b>to</b> help.
<br>   “I am troubled, for <b>the</b> first time since I have known him. We should have had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many days ago, I heard <b>the</b> ill news. The tidings had gone far <b>and</b> wide that Gandalf was missing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> horsemen had been seen. It was <b>the</b> Elven-folk <b>of</b> Gildor that told me this; <b>and</b> later they told me that you had left your home; <b>but</b> there was <b>no</b> news <b>of</b> your leaving Buckland. I have been watching <b>the</b> East Road anxiously.”
<br>   “Do you think <b>the</b> Black Riders have anything <b>to</b> do with <b>it</b>—with Gandalf's absence, I mean?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “I do not know <b>of</b> anything else that could have hindered him, except <b>the</b> Enemy himself,” said Strider. “But do not give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know—as a rule you can only see his jokes <b>and</b> toys. But this business <b>of</b> ours will be his greatest task.”
<br>   Pippin yawned. “I am sorry,” he said, “<b>but</b> I am dead tired. In spite <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> danger <b>and</b> worry I must go <b>to</b> bed, <b>or</b> sleep where I sit. Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be <b>the</b> last straw, if we had <b>to</b> go out in <b>the</b> dark <b>to</b> look for him.”
<br>   At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along <b>the</b> passage. Merry came in with a rush followed <b>by</b> Nob. He shut <b>the</b> door hastily, <b>and</b> leaned against <b>it</b>. He was out <b>of</b> breath. They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: “I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!”
<br>   “Black Riders!” cried Frodo. “Where?”
<br>   “Here. In <b>the</b> village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again <b>and</b> was standing just outside <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lamp looking at <b>the</b> stars. Suddenly I shivered <b>and</b> felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son <b>of</b> deeper shade among <b>the</b> shadows across <b>the</b> road, just beyond <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lamplight. It slid away at once <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark without a sound. There was <b>no</b> horse.”
<br>   “Which way did <b>it</b> go?” asked Strider, suddenly <b>and</b> sharply. Merry started, noticing <b>the</b> stranger for <b>the</b> first time. “Go <b>on</b>!” said Frodo. “This is a friend <b>of</b> Gandalf's. I will explain later.”
<br>   “It seemed <b>to</b> make off up <b>the</b> Road, eastward,” continued Merry. “I tried <b>to</b> follow. Of course, <b>it</b> vanished almost at once; <b>but</b> I went round <b>the</b> corner <b>and</b> <b>on</b> as far as <b>the</b> last house <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   Strider looked at Merry with wonder. “You have a stout heart,” he said; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> was foolish.”
<br>   “I don't know,” said Merry. “Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed <b>to</b> be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, <b>and</b> suddenly I heard voices <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hedge. One was muttering; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other was whispering, <b>or</b> hissing. I couldn't hear a word that was said. I did not creep any closer, because I began <b>to</b> tremble all over. Then I felt terrified, <b>and</b> I turned back, <b>and</b> was just going <b>to</b> bolt home, when something came behind me <b>and</b> I... I fell over.”
<br>   “I found him, sir,” put in Nob. “Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. I went down <b>to</b> West-gate, <b>and</b> then back up towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny's house I thought I could see something in <b>the</b> Road. I couldn't swear <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> looked <b>to</b> me as if two men was stooping over something, lilting <b>it</b>. I gave a shout, <b>but</b> where I got up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spot there was <b>no</b> signs <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> only Mr. Brandybuck lying <b>by</b> <b>the</b> roadside. He seemed <b>to</b> be asleep. “I thought I had fallen <b>into</b> deep water,” he says <b>to</b> me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, <b>and</b> as soon as I had roused him, he got up <b>and</b> ran back here like a hare.”
<br>   “I am afraid that's true,” said Merry, “though I don't know what I said. I had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went <b>to</b> pieces. I don't know what came over me.”
<br>   “I do,” said Strider. “The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside, <b>and</b> passed back through <b>the</b> South-gate in secret. They will know all <b>the</b> news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; <b>and</b> probably that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in <b>the</b> night, before we leave Bree.”
<br>   “What will happen?” said Merry. “Will they attack <b>the</b> inn?” “No, I think not,” said Strider. “They are not all here yet. And in any case that is not their way. In dark <b>and</b> loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights <b>and</b> many people -not until they are desperate, not while all <b>the</b> long leagues <b>of</b> Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, <b>and</b> already some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches <b>to</b> some evil work: Ferny, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strangers, <b>and</b>, maybe, <b>the</b> gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at West-gate <b>on</b> Monday. I was watching them. He was white <b>and</b> shaking when they left him.”
<br>   “We seem <b>to</b> have enemies all round,” said Frodo. “What are we <b>to</b> do?”
<br>   “Stay here, <b>and</b> do not go <b>to</b> your rooms! They are sure <b>to</b> have found out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north <b>and</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. We will all remain together <b>and</b> bar this window <b>and</b> <b>the</b> door. But first Nob <b>and</b> I will fetch your luggage.”
<br>   While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account <b>of</b> all that had happened since supper. Merry was still reading <b>and</b> pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider <b>and</b> Nob returned.
<br>   “Well Masters,” said Nob, “I've ruffled up <b>the</b> clothes <b>and</b> put in a bolster down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> each bed. And I made a nice imitation <b>of</b> your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag—Underhill, sir,” he added with a grin.
<br>   Pippin laughed. “Very life-like!” he said. “But what will happen when they have penetrated <b>the</b> disguise?”
<br>   “We shall see,” said Strider. “Let us hope <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> fort till morning.”
<br>   “Good night <b>to</b> you,” said Nob, <b>and</b> went off <b>to</b> take his part in <b>the</b> watch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doors.
<br>   Their bags <b>and</b> gear they piled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parlour-floor. They pushed a low chair against <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> shut <b>the</b> window. Peering out, Frodo saw that <b>the</b> night was still clear. The Sickle was swinging bright above <b>the</b> shoulders <b>of</b> Bree-hill. He then closed <b>and</b> barred <b>the</b> heavy inside shutters <b>and</b> drew <b>the</b> curtains together. Strider built up <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> blew out all <b>the</b> candles.
<br>   The hobbits lay down <b>on</b> their blankets with their feet towards <b>the</b> hearth; <b>but</b> Strider settled himself in <b>the</b> chair against <b>the</b> door. They talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions <b>to</b> ask.
<br>   “Jumped over <b>the</b> Moon!” chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his blanket. “Very ridiculous <b>of</b> you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there <b>to</b> see. The worthies <b>of</b> Bree will be discussing <b>it</b> a hundred years hence.”
<br>   “I hope so,” said Strider. Then they all fell silent, <b>and</b> one <b>by</b> one <b>the</b> hobbits dropped off <b>to</b> sleep.
<br>   
<br>   
<br>Chapter 11
<br>A KNIFE IN THE DARK
<br>
<br>   As they prepared for sleep in <b>the</b> inn at Bree, darkness lay <b>on</b> Buckland; a mist strayed in <b>the</b> dells <b>and</b> along <b>the</b> river-bank. The house at Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened <b>the</b> door cautiously <b>and</b> peered out. A feeling <b>of</b> fear had been growing <b>on</b> him all day, <b>and</b> he was unable <b>to</b> rest <b>or</b> go <b>to</b> bed: there was a brooding threat in <b>the</b> breathless night-air. As he stared out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom, a black shadow moved under <b>the</b> trees; <b>the</b> gate seemed <b>to</b> open <b>of</b> its own accord <b>and</b> close again without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, <b>and</b> for a moment he stood trembling in <b>the</b> hall. Then he shut <b>and</b> locked <b>the</b> door.
<br>   The night deepened. There came <b>the</b> soft sound <b>of</b> horses led with stealth along <b>the</b> lane. Outside <b>the</b> gate they stopped, <b>and</b> three black figures entered, like shades <b>of</b> night creeping across <b>the</b> ground. One went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>on</b> either side; <b>and</b> there they stood, as still as <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> stones, while night went slowly <b>on</b>. The house <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quiet trees seemed <b>to</b> be waiting breathlessly.
<br>   There was a faint stir in <b>the</b> leaves, <b>and</b> a cock crowed far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door moved. In <b>the</b> dark without moon <b>or</b> stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft <b>but</b> heavy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> door shuddered.
<br>   “Open, in <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Mordor!” said a voice thin <b>and</b> menacing.
<br>   At a second blow <b>the</b> door yielded <b>and</b> fell back, with timbers burst <b>and</b> lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in.
<br>   At that moment, among <b>the</b> trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent <b>the</b> night like fire <b>on</b> a hill-top.
<br>   awake! fear! fire! foes! awake!
<br>   Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw <b>the</b> dark shapes creep from <b>the</b> garden, he knew that he must run for <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> perish. And run he did, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back door, through <b>the</b> garden, <b>and</b> over <b>the</b> fields. When he reached <b>the</b> nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep. “No, <b>no</b>, <b>no</b>!” he was crying. “No, not me! I haven't got <b>it</b>!” It was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about. At last they got <b>the</b> idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion from <b>the</b> Old Forest. And then they lost <b>no</b> more time.
<br>   fear! fire! foes!
<br>   The Brandybucks were blowing <b>the</b> Horn-call <b>of</b> Buckland, that had not been sounded for a hundred years, not since <b>the</b> white wolves came in <b>the</b> Fell Winter, when <b>the</b> Brandywine was frozen over.
<br>   awake! awake!
<br>   Far-away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black figures fled from <b>the</b> house. One <b>of</b> them let fall a hobbit-cloak <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step, as he ran. In <b>the</b> lane <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> hoofs broke out, <b>and</b> gathering <b>to</b> a gallop, went hammering away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. All about Crickhollow there was <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> horns blowing, <b>and</b> voices crying <b>and</b> feet running. But <b>the</b> Black Riders rode like a gale <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North-gate. Let <b>the</b> little people blow! Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they knew now that <b>the</b> house was empty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring had gone. They rode down <b>the</b> guards at <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> vanished from <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   In <b>the</b> early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some sound <b>or</b> presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert in his chair: his eyes gleamed in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, which had been tended <b>and</b> was burning brightly; <b>but</b> he made <b>no</b> sign <b>or</b> movement.
<br>   Frodo soon went <b>to</b> sleep again; <b>but</b> his dreams were again troubled with <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> wind <b>and</b> <b>of</b> galloping hoofs. The wind seemed <b>to</b> be curling round <b>the</b> house <b>and</b> shaking <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, <b>and</b> heard a cock crowing lustily in <b>the</b> inn-yard. Strider had drawn <b>the</b> curtains <b>and</b> pushed back <b>the</b> shutters with a clang. The first grey light <b>of</b> day was in <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> a cold air was coming through <b>the</b> open window.
<br>   As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> their bedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: <b>the</b> windows had been forced open <b>and</b> were swinging, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> curtains were flapping; <b>the</b> beds were tossed about, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bolsters slashed <b>and</b> flung upon <b>the</b> floor; <b>the</b> brown mat was torn <b>to</b> pieces.
<br>   Strider immediately went <b>to</b> fetch <b>the</b> landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy <b>and</b> frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he said), <b>but</b> he had never heard a sound.
<br>   “Never has such a thing happened in my time!” he cried, raising his hands in horror. “Guests unable <b>to</b> sleep in their beds, <b>and</b> good bolsters ruined <b>and</b> all! What are we coming <b>to</b>?”
<br>   “Dark times,” said Strider. “But for <b>the</b> present you may be left in peace, when you have got rid <b>of</b> us. We will leave at once. Never mind about breakfast: a drink <b>and</b> a bite standing will have <b>to</b> do. We shall be packed in a few minutes.”
<br>   Mr. Butterbur hurried off <b>to</b> see that their ponies were got ready, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> fetch them a “bite”. But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> they were gone: not only Merry's ponies, <b>but</b> every other horse <b>and</b> beast in <b>the</b> place.
<br>   Frodo was crushed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news. How could they hope <b>to</b> reach Rivendell <b>on</b> foot, pursued <b>by</b> mounted enemies? They might as well set out for <b>the</b> Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at <b>the</b> hobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength <b>and</b> courage.
<br>   “Ponies would not help us <b>to</b> escape horsemen,” he said at last, thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. “We should not go much slower <b>on</b> foot, not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads that I mean <b>to</b> take. I was going <b>to</b> walk in any case. It is <b>the</b> food <b>and</b> stores that trouble me. We cannot count <b>on</b> getting anything <b>to</b> eat between here <b>and</b> Rivendell, except what we take with us; <b>and</b> we ought <b>to</b> take plenty <b>to</b> spare; for we may be delayed, <b>or</b> forced <b>to</b> go round-about, far out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct way. How much are you prepared <b>to</b> carry <b>on</b> your backs?”
<br>   “As much as we must,” said Pippin with a sinking heart, <b>but</b> trying <b>to</b> show that he was tougher than he looked (<b>or</b> felt).
<br>   “I can carry enough for two,” said Sam defiantly.
<br>   “Can't anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?” asked Frodo. “Can't we get a couple <b>of</b> ponies in <b>the</b> village, <b>or</b> even one just for <b>the</b> baggage? I don't suppose we could hire them, <b>but</b> we might be able <b>to</b> buy them,” he added, doubtfully, wondering if he could afford <b>it</b>.
<br>   “I doubt <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> landlord unhappily. “The two <b>or</b> three riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, <b>and</b> they're gone. As for other animals, horses <b>or</b> ponies for draught <b>or</b> what not, there are very few <b>of</b> them in Bree, <b>and</b> they won't be for sale. But I'll do what I can. I'll rout out Bob <b>and</b> send him round as soon as may be.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Strider reluctantly, “you had better do that. I am afraid we shall have <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> get one pony at least. But so ends all hope <b>of</b> starting early, <b>and</b> slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a horn <b>to</b> announce our departure. That was part <b>of</b> their plan, <b>no</b> doubt.”
<br>   “There is one crumb <b>of</b> comfort,” said Merry, “<b>and</b> more than a crumb, I hope: we can have breakfast while we wait—<b>and</b> sit down <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. Let's get hold <b>of</b> Nob!”
<br>   In <b>the</b> end there was more than three hours” delay. Bob came back with <b>the</b> report that <b>no</b> horse <b>or</b> pony was <b>to</b> be got for love <b>or</b> money in <b>the</b> neighbourhood—except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell. “A poor old half-starved creature <b>it</b> is,” said Bob; “<b>but</b> he won't part with <b>it</b> for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you're placed, not if I knows Bill Ferny.”
<br>   “Bill Ferny?” said Frodo. “Isn't there some trick? Wouldn't <b>the</b> beast bolt back <b>to</b> him with all our stuff, <b>or</b> help in tracking us, <b>or</b> something?”
<br>   “I wonder,” said Strider. “But I cannot imagine any animal running home <b>to</b> him, once <b>it</b> got away. I fancy this is only an afterthought <b>of</b> kind Master Ferny's: just a way <b>of</b> increasing his profits from <b>the</b> affair. The chief danger is that <b>the</b> poor beast is probably at death's door. But there does not seem any choice. What does he want for <b>it</b>?”
<br>   Bill Ferny's price was twelve silver pennies; <b>and</b> that was indeed at least three times <b>the</b> pony's value in those pans. It proved <b>to</b> be a bony, underfed, <b>and</b> dispirited animal; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> did not look like dying just yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for <b>it</b> himself, <b>and</b> offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for <b>the</b> lost animals. He was an honest man, <b>and</b> well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; <b>but</b> thirty silver pennies was a sore blow <b>to</b> him, <b>and</b> being cheated <b>by</b> Bill Ferny made <b>it</b> harder <b>to</b> bear.
<br>   As a matter <b>of</b> fact he came out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side in <b>the</b> end. It turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen. The others had been driven off, <b>or</b> had bolted in terror, <b>and</b> were found wandering in different corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land. Merry's ponies had escaped altogether, <b>and</b> eventually (having a good deal <b>of</b> sense) they made their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Downs in search <b>of</b> Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> Tom Bombadil for a while, <b>and</b> were well-off. But when news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events at Bree came <b>to</b> Tom's ears, he sent them <b>to</b> Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price. They had <b>to</b> work harder in Bree, <b>but</b> Bob treated them well; so <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole they were lucky: they missed a dark <b>and</b> dangerous journey. But they never came <b>to</b> Rivendell.
<br>   However, in <b>the</b> meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone for good, <b>or</b> for bad. And he had other troubles. For there was a great commotion as soon as <b>the</b> remaining guests were astir <b>and</b> heard news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses <b>and</b> blamed <b>the</b> innkeeper loudly, until <b>it</b> became known that one <b>of</b> their own number had also disappeared in <b>the</b> night, none other than Bill Ferny's squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell <b>on</b> him at once.
<br>   “If you pick up with a horse-thief, <b>and</b> bring him <b>to</b> my house,” said Butterbur angrily, “you ought <b>to</b> pay for all <b>the</b> damage yourselves <b>and</b> not come shouting at me. Go <b>and</b> ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!” But <b>it</b> appeared that he was nobody's friend, <b>and</b> nobody could recollect when he had joined their party.
<br>   After their breakfast <b>the</b> hobbits had <b>to</b> re-pack, <b>and</b> get together further supplies for <b>the</b> longer journey they were now expecting. It was close <b>on</b> ten o'clock before they at last got off. By that time <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo's vanishing trick; <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black horsemen; <b>the</b> robbing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stables; <b>and</b> not least <b>the</b> news that Strider <b>the</b> Ranger had joined <b>the</b> mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> Bree <b>and</b> Staddle, <b>and</b> many even from Combe <b>and</b> Archet, were crowded in <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> travellers start. The other guests in <b>the</b> inn were at <b>the</b> doors <b>or</b> hanging out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows.
<br>   Strider had changed his mind, <b>and</b> he decided <b>to</b> leave Bree <b>by</b> <b>the</b> main road. Any attempt <b>to</b> set off across country at once would only make matters worse: half <b>the</b> inhabitants would follow them, <b>to</b> see what they were up <b>to</b>, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from trespassing.
<br>   They said farewell <b>to</b> Nob <b>and</b> Bob, <b>and</b> took leave <b>of</b> Mr. Butterbur with many thanks. “I hope we shall meet again some day, when things are merry once more,” said Frodo. “I should like nothing better than <b>to</b> stay in your house in peace for a while.”
<br>   They tramped off, anxious <b>and</b> downhearted, under <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd. Not all <b>the</b> faces were friendly, nor all <b>the</b> words that were shouted. But Strider seemed <b>to</b> be held in awe <b>by</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-landers, <b>and</b> those that he stared at shut their mouths <b>and</b> drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry <b>and</b> Pippin; <b>and</b> last came Sam leading <b>the</b> pony, which was laden with as much <b>of</b> their baggage as they had <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> give <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> already <b>it</b> looked less dejected, as if <b>it</b> approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> change in its fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full <b>of</b> them: a parting present from Nob <b>and</b> Bob. “Apples for walking, <b>and</b> a pipe for sitting,” he said. “But I reckon I'll miss them both before long.”
<br>   The hobbits took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inquisitive heads that peeped out <b>of</b> doors, <b>or</b> popped over walls <b>and</b> fences, as they passed. But as they drew near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick hedge: <b>the</b> last house in <b>the</b> village. In one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> vanished at once.
<br>   “So that's where that southerner is hiding!” he thought. “He looks more than half like a goblin.”
<br>   Over <b>the</b> hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy black brows, <b>and</b> dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. He was smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he took <b>it</b> out <b>of</b> his mouth <b>and</b> spat.
<br>   “Morning, Longshanks!” he said. “Off early? Found some friends at last?” Strider nodded, <b>but</b> did not answer. “Morning, my little friends!” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “I suppose you know who you've taken up with? That's Stick-at-naught Strider, that is! Though I've heard other names not so pretty. Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don't go ill-treating my poor old pony! Pah!” He spat again.
<br>   Sam turned quickly. “And you. Ferny,” he said, “put your ugly face out <b>of</b> sight, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> will get hurt.” With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an apple left his hand <b>and</b> hit Bill square <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nose. He ducked too late, <b>and</b> curses came from behind <b>the</b> hedge. “Waste <b>of</b> a good apple,” said Sam regretfully, <b>and</b> strode <b>on</b>.
<br>   At last they left <b>the</b> village behind. The escort <b>of</b> children <b>and</b> stragglers that had followed them got tired <b>and</b> turned back at <b>the</b> South-gate. Passing through, they kept <b>on</b> along <b>the</b> Road for some miles. It bent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, curving back <b>into</b> its eastward line as <b>it</b> rounded <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> Bree-hill, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> run swiftly downwards <b>into</b> wooded country. To their left they could see some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses <b>and</b> hobbit-holes <b>of</b> Staddle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gentler south-eastern slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill; down in a deep hollow away north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road there were wisps <b>of</b> rising smoke that showed where Combe lay;
<br>   Archet was hidden in <b>the</b> trees beyond.
<br>   After <b>the</b> Road had run down some way, <b>and</b> had left Bree-hill standing tall <b>and</b> brown behind, they came <b>on</b> a narrow track that led off towards <b>the</b> North. “This is where we leave <b>the</b> open <b>and</b> take <b>to</b> cover,” said Strider.
<br>   “Not a “short cut", I hope,” said Pippin. “Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster.”
<br>   “Ah, <b>but</b> you had not got me with you then,” laughed Strider. “My cuts, short <b>or</b> long, don't go wrong.” He took a look up <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> Road. No one was in sight; <b>and</b> he led <b>the</b> way quickly down towards <b>the</b> wooded valley.
<br>   His plan, as far as they could understand <b>it</b> without knowing <b>the</b> country, was <b>to</b> go towards Archet at first, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> bear right <b>and</b> pass <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east, <b>and</b> then <b>to</b> steer as straight as he could over <b>the</b> wild lands <b>to</b> Weathertop Hill. In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, which further <b>on</b> bent southwards <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> Midgewater Marshes. But, <b>of</b> course, they would have <b>to</b> pass through <b>the</b> marshes themselves, <b>and</b> Strider's description <b>of</b> them was not encouraging.
<br>   However, in <b>the</b> meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed, if <b>it</b> had not been for <b>the</b> disturbing events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night before, they would have enjoyed this pan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey better than any up <b>to</b> that time. The sun was shining, clear <b>but</b> not too hot. The woods in <b>the</b> valley were still leafy <b>and</b> full <b>of</b> colour, <b>and</b> seemed peaceful <b>and</b> wholesome. Strider guided them confidently among <b>the</b> many crossing paths, although left <b>to</b> themselves they would soon have been at a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many turns <b>and</b> doublings, <b>to</b> put off any pursuit.
<br>   “Bill Ferny will have watched where we left <b>the</b> Road, for certain,” he said; “though I don't think he will follow us himself. He knows <b>the</b> land round here well enough, <b>but</b> he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. It is what he may tell others that I am afraid <b>of</b>. I don't suppose they are far away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much <b>the</b> better.”
<br>   Whether because <b>of</b> Strider's skill <b>or</b> for some other reason, they saw <b>no</b> sign <b>and</b> heard <b>no</b> sound <b>of</b> any other living thing all that day: neither two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox <b>and</b> a few squirrels. The next day they began <b>to</b> steer a steady course eastwards; <b>and</b> still all was quiet <b>and</b> peaceful. On <b>the</b> third day out from Bree they came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chetwood. The land had been falling steadily, ever since they turned aside from <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> they now entered a wide flat expanse <b>of</b> country, much more difficult <b>to</b> manage. They were far beyond <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land, out in <b>the</b> pathless wilderness, <b>and</b> drawing near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Midge-water Marshes.
<br>   The ground now became damp, <b>and</b> in places boggy <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there they came upon pools, <b>and</b> wide stretches <b>of</b> reeds <b>and</b> rushes filled with <b>the</b> warbling <b>of</b> little hidden birds. They had <b>to</b> pick their way carefully <b>to</b> keep both dry-footed <b>and</b> <b>on</b> their proper course. At first they made fan-progress, <b>but</b> as they went <b>on</b>, their passage became slower <b>and</b> more dangerous. The marshes were bewildering <b>and</b> treacherous, <b>and</b> there was <b>no</b> permanent trail even for Rangers <b>to</b> find through their shifting quagmires. The flies began <b>to</b> torment them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> air was full <b>of</b> clouds <b>of</b> tiny midges that crept up their sleeves <b>and</b> breeches <b>and</b> <b>into</b> their hair.
<br>   “I am being eaten alive!” cried Pippin. “Midgewater! There are more midges than water!”
<br>   “What do they live <b>on</b> when they can't get hobbit?” asked Sam, scratching his neck.
<br>   They spent a miserable day in this lonely <b>and</b> unpleasant country. Their camping-place was damp, cold, <b>and</b> uncomfortable; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> biting insects would not let them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting <b>the</b> reeds <b>and</b> tussocks that from <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> them were evil relatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cricket. There were thousands <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> they squeaked all round, neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all <b>the</b> night, until <b>the</b> hobbits were nearly frantic.
<br>   The next day, <b>the</b> fourth, was little better, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> night almost as comfortless. Though <b>the</b> Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left behind, <b>the</b> midges still pursued them.
<br>   As Frodo lay, tired <b>but</b> unable <b>to</b> close his eyes, <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that far away there came a light in <b>the</b> eastern sky: <b>it</b> flashed <b>and</b> faded many times. It was not <b>the</b> dawn, for that was still some hours off.
<br>   “What is <b>the</b> light?” he said <b>to</b> Strider, who had risen, <b>and</b> was standing, gazing ahead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   “I do not know,” Strider answered. “It is too distant <b>to</b> make out. It is like lightning that leaps up from <b>the</b> hill-tops.”
<br>   Frodo lay down again, <b>but</b> for a long while he could still see <b>the</b> white flashes, <b>and</b> against them <b>the</b> tall dark figure <b>of</b> Strider, standing silent <b>and</b> watchful. At last he passed <b>into</b> uneasy sleep.
<br>   They had not gone far <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fifth day when they left <b>the</b> last straggling pools <b>and</b> reed-beds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marshes behind them. The land before them began steadily <b>to</b> rise again. Away in <b>the</b> distance eastward they could now see a line <b>of</b> hills. The highest <b>of</b> them was at <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>and</b> a little separated from <b>the</b> others. It had a conical top, slightly flattened at <b>the</b> summit.
<br>   “That is Weathertop,” said Strider. “The Old Road, which we have left far away <b>on</b> our right, runs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> passes not far from its foot. We might reach <b>it</b> <b>by</b> noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards <b>it</b>. I suppose we had better do so.”
<br>   “What do you mean?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “I mean: when we do get there, <b>it</b> is not certain what we shall find. It is close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   “But surely we were hoping <b>to</b> find Gandalf there?”
<br>   “Yes; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not pass through Bree, <b>and</b> so he may not know what we are doing. And anyway, unless <b>by</b> luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; <b>it</b> will not be safe for him <b>or</b> for us <b>to</b> wait there long. If <b>the</b> Riders fail <b>to</b> find us in <b>the</b> wilderness, they are likely <b>to</b> make for Weathertop themselves. It commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are many birds <b>and</b> beasts in this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not all <b>the</b> birds are <b>to</b> be trusted, <b>and</b> there are other spies more evil than they are.”
<br>   The hobbits looked anxiously at <b>the</b> distant hills. Sam looked up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pale sky, fearing <b>to</b> see hawks <b>or</b> eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes. “You do make me feel uncomfortable <b>and</b> lonesome, Strider!” he said.
<br>   “What do you advise us <b>to</b> do?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “I think,” answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, “I think <b>the</b> best thing is <b>to</b> go as straight eastward from here as we can, <b>to</b> make for <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path I know that runs at their feet; <b>it</b> will bring us <b>to</b> Weathertop from <b>the</b> north <b>and</b> less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.”
<br>   All that day they plodded along, until <b>the</b> cold <b>and</b> early evening came down. The land became drier <b>and</b> more barren; <b>but</b> mists <b>and</b> vapours lay behind them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marshes. A few melancholy birds were piping <b>and</b> wailing, until <b>the</b> round red sun sank slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> western shadows; then an empty silence fell. The hobbits thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soft light <b>of</b> sunset glancing through <b>the</b> cheerful windows <b>of</b> Bag End far away.
<br>   At <b>the</b> day's end they came <b>to</b> a stream that wandered down from <b>the</b> hills <b>to</b> lose itself in <b>the</b> stagnant marshland, <b>and</b> they went up along its banks while <b>the</b> light lasted. It was already night when at last they halted <b>and</b> made their camp under some stunted alder-trees <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream. Ahead there loomed now against <b>the</b> dusky sky <b>the</b> bleak <b>and</b> treeless backs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills. That night they set a watch, <b>and</b> Strider, <b>it</b> seemed, did not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> early night-hours a cold grey light lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land.
<br>   Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a frost in <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, as if they had had a night <b>of</b> unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used <b>to</b> much walking <b>on</b> short commons—shorter at any rate than what in <b>the</b> Shire they would have thought barely enough <b>to</b> keep them <b>on</b> their legs. Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice <b>the</b> hobbit that he had been.
<br>   “Very odd,” said Frodo, tightening his belt, “considering that there is actually a good deal less <b>of</b> me. I hope <b>the</b> thinning process will not go <b>on</b> indefinitely, <b>or</b> I shall become a wraith.”
<br>   “Do not speak <b>of</b> such things!” said Strider quickly, <b>and</b> with surprising earnestness.
<br>   The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising almost <b>to</b> a thousand feet, <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there falling again <b>to</b> low clefts <b>or</b> passes leading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eastern land beyond. Along <b>the</b> crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge <b>the</b> hobbits could see what looked <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> green-grown walls <b>and</b> dikes, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> clefts there still stood <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> old works <b>of</b> stone. By night they had reached <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> westward slopes, <b>and</b> there they camped. It was <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>of</b> October, <b>and</b> they were six days out from Bree.
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning they found, for <b>the</b> first time since they had left <b>the</b> Chetwood, a track plain <b>to</b> see. They turned right <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b> southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as <b>to</b> keep as much hidden as possible from <b>the</b> view, both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill-tops above <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. It dived <b>into</b> dells, <b>and</b> hugged steep banks; <b>and</b> where <b>it</b> passed over flatter <b>and</b> more open ground <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> <b>it</b> there were lines <b>of</b> large boulders <b>and</b> hewn stones that screened <b>the</b> travellers almost like a hedge.
<br>   “I wonder who made this path, <b>and</b> what for,” said Merry, as they walked along one <b>of</b> these avenues, where <b>the</b> stones were unusually large <b>and</b> closely set. “I am not sure that I like <b>it</b>: <b>it</b> has a—well, rather a barrow-wightish look. Is there any barrow <b>on</b> Weathertop?”
<br>   “No. There is <b>no</b> barrow <b>on</b> Weathertop, nor <b>on</b> any <b>of</b> these hills,” answered Strider. “The Men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West did not live here; though in their latter days they defended <b>the</b> hills for a while against <b>the</b> evil that came out <b>of</b> Angmar. This path was made <b>to</b> serve <b>the</b> forts along <b>the</b> walls. But long before, in <b>the</b> first days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Kingdom, they built a great watch-tower <b>on</b> Weathertop, Amon S?l they called <b>it</b>. It was burned <b>and</b> broken, <b>and</b> nothing remains <b>of</b> <b>it</b> now <b>but</b> a tumbled ring, like a rough crown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old hill's head. Yet once <b>it</b> was tall <b>and</b> fair. It is told that Elendil stood there watching for <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> Gil-galad out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Alliance.”
<br>   The hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old lore, as well as in <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild. “Who was Gil-galad?” asked Merry; <b>but</b> Strider did not answer, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> be lost in thought. Suddenly a low voice murmured:
<br>   
<br>Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
<br>Of him <b>the</b> harpers sadly sing:
<br><b>the</b> last whose realm was fair <b>and</b> free
<br>between <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea.
<br>
<br>His sword was long, his lance was keen,
<br>his shining helm afar was seen;
<br><b>the</b> countless stars <b>of</b> heaven's field
<br>were mirrored in his silver shield.
<br>
<br>But long ago he rode away,
<br><b>and</b> where he dwelleth none can say;
<br>for <b>into</b> darkness fell his star
<br>in Mordor where <b>the</b> shadows are.
<br>   
<br>   The others turned in amazement, for <b>the</b> voice was Sam's.
<br>   “Don't stop!” said Merry.
<br>   “That's all I know,” stammered Sam, blushing. “I learned <b>it</b> from Mr. Bilbo when I was a lad. He used <b>to</b> tell me tales like that, knowing how I was always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo as taught me my letters. He was mighty book-learned was dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote poetry. He wrote what I have just said.”
<br>   “He did not make <b>it</b> up,” said Strider. “It is pan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lay that is called The Fall <b>of</b> Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have translated <b>it</b>. I never knew that.”
<br>   “There was a lot more,” said Sam, “all about Mordor. I didn't learn that part, <b>it</b> gave me <b>the</b> shivers I never thought I should be going that way myself!”
<br>   “Going <b>to</b> Mordor!” cried Pippin. “I hope <b>it</b> won't come <b>to</b> that!”
<br>   “Do not speak that name so loudly!” said Strider.
<br>   It was already mid-day when they drew near <b>the</b> southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> saw before them, in <b>the</b> pale clear light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northward slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill They decided <b>to</b> make for <b>the</b> top at once, while <b>the</b> daylight was broad Concealment was <b>no</b> longer possible, <b>and</b> they could only hope that <b>no</b> enemy <b>or</b> spy was observing them. Nothing was <b>to</b> be seen moving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill. If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> him.
<br>   On <b>the</b> western flank <b>of</b> Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> which there was a bowl-shaped dell with grassy sides. There they left Sam <b>and</b> Pippin with <b>the</b> pony <b>and</b> their packs <b>and</b> luggage. The other three went <b>on</b>. After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached <b>the</b> crown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill; Frodo <b>and</b> Merry followed, tired <b>and</b> breathless. The last slope had been steep <b>and</b> rocky.
<br>   On <b>the</b> top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring <b>of</b> ancient stonework, now crumbling <b>or</b> covered with age-long grass. But in <b>the</b> centre a cairn <b>of</b> broken stones had been piled. They were blackened as if with fire. About them <b>the</b> turf was burned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roots <b>and</b> all within <b>the</b> ring <b>the</b> grass was scorched <b>and</b> shrivelled, as if flames had swept <b>the</b> hill-top; <b>but</b> there was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> any living thing.
<br>   Standing upon <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruined circle, they saw all round below them a wide prospect, for <b>the</b> most pan <b>of</b> lands empty <b>and</b> featureless, except for patches <b>of</b> woodland away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, beyond which they caught here <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> glint <b>of</b> distant water. Beneath them <b>on</b> this southern side there ran like a ribbon <b>the</b> Old Road, coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> winding up <b>and</b> down, until <b>it</b> faded behind a ridge <b>of</b> dark land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. Nothing was moving <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Following its line eastward with their eyes they saw <b>the</b> Mountains: <b>the</b> nearer foothills were brown <b>and</b> sombre;
<br>   behind them stood taller shapes <b>of</b> grey, <b>and</b> behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among <b>the</b> clouds.
<br>   “Well, here we are!” said Merry. “And very cheerless <b>and</b> uninviting <b>it</b> looks! There is <b>no</b> water <b>and</b> <b>no</b> shelter. And <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> Gandalf. But I don't blame him for not waiting—if he ever came here.”
<br>   “I wonder,” said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. “Even if he was a day <b>or</b> two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first. He can ride very swiftly when need presses.” Suddenly he stooped <b>and</b> looked at <b>the</b> stone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cairn; <b>it</b> was flatter than <b>the</b> others, <b>and</b> whiter, as if <b>it</b> had escaped <b>the</b> fire. He picked <b>it</b> up <b>and</b> examined <b>it</b>, turning <b>it</b> in his fingers. “This has been handled recently,” he said. “What do you think <b>of</b> these marks?”
<br>   On <b>the</b> flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches:  “There seems <b>to</b> he a stroke, a dot, <b>and</b> three more strokes,” he said.
<br>   “The stroke <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left might be a G-rune with thin branches,” said Strider. “It might be a sign left <b>by</b> Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The scratches are fine, <b>and</b> they certainly look fresh. But <b>the</b> marks might mean something quite different, <b>and</b> have nothing <b>to</b> do with us. Rangers use runes, <b>and</b> they come here sometimes.”
<br>   “What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?” asked Merry
<br>   “I should say,” answered Strider, “that they stood for G3, <b>and</b> were a sign that Gandalf was here <b>on</b> October <b>the</b> third: that is three days ago now. It would also show that he was in a hurry <b>and</b> danger was at hand, so that he had <b>no</b> time <b>or</b> did not dare <b>to</b> write anything longer <b>or</b> plainer. If that is so, we must be wary.”
<br>   “I wish we could feel sure that he made <b>the</b> marks, whatever they may mean,” said Frodo “It would be a great comfort <b>to</b> know that he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way, in front <b>of</b> us <b>or</b> behind us.”
<br>   “Perhaps,” said Strider. “For myself, I believe that he was here, <b>and</b> was in danger. There have been scorching flames here; <b>and</b> now <b>the</b> light that we saw three nights ago in <b>the</b> eastern sky comes back <b>to</b> my mind. I guess that he was attacked <b>on</b> this hill-top, <b>but</b> with what result I cannot tell. He is here <b>no</b> longer, <b>and</b> we must now look after ourselves <b>and</b> make our own way <b>to</b> Rivendell, as best we can”
<br>   “How far is Rivendell?” asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world looked wild <b>and</b> wide from Weathertop.
<br>   “I don't know if <b>the</b> Road has ever been measured in miles beyond <b>the</b> Forsaken Inn, a day's journey east <b>of</b> Bree,” answered Strider. “Some say <b>it</b> is so far, <b>and</b> some say otherwise. It is a strange road, <b>and</b> folk are glad <b>to</b> reach their journey's end, whether <b>the</b> time is long <b>or</b> short. But I know how long <b>it</b> would take me <b>on</b> my own feet, with fair weather <b>and</b> <b>no</b> ill fortune twelve days from here <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen, where <b>the</b> Road crosses <b>the</b> Loudwater that runs out <b>of</b> Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight's journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   “A fortnight!” said Frodo. “A lot may happen in that time.”
<br>   “It may,” said Strider.
<br>   They stood for a while silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top, near its southward edge. In that lonely place Frodo for <b>the</b> first time fully realized his homelessness <b>and</b> danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in <b>the</b> quiet <b>and</b> beloved Shire. He stared down at <b>the</b> hateful Road, leading back westward—<b>to</b> his home. Suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along <b>it</b>, going westward; <b>and</b> looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward <b>to</b> meet them. He gave a cry <b>and</b> clutched Strider's arm.
<br>   “Look,” he said, pointing downwards.
<br>   At once Strider flung himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground behind <b>the</b> ruined circle, pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside.
<br>   “What is <b>it</b>?” he whispered.
<br>   “I do not know, <b>but</b> I fear <b>the</b> worst,” answered Strider.
<br>   Slowly they crawled up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring again, <b>and</b> peered through a cleft between two jagged stones. The light was <b>no</b> longer bright, for <b>the</b> clear morning had faded, <b>and</b> clouds creeping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East had now overtaken <b>the</b> sun, as <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> go down. They could all see <b>the</b> black specks, <b>but</b> neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road beyond <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill.
<br>   “Yes,” said Strider, whose keener sight left him in <b>no</b> doubt. “The enemy is here!”
<br>   Hastily they crept away <b>and</b> slipped down <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>to</b> find their companions.
<br>   Sam <b>and</b> Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored <b>the</b> small dell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a spring <b>of</b> clear water in <b>the</b> hillside, <b>and</b> near <b>it</b> footprints not more than a day <b>or</b> two old. In <b>the</b> dell itself they found recent traces <b>of</b> a fire, <b>and</b> other signs <b>of</b> a hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell nearest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill. Behind them Sam came upon a small store <b>of</b> firewood neatly stacked.
<br>   “I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,” he said <b>to</b> Pippin. “Whoever <b>it</b> was put this stuff here meant <b>to</b> come back <b>it</b> seems.”
<br>   Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries. “I wish I had waited <b>and</b> explored <b>the</b> ground down here myself,” he said, hurrying off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spring <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> footprints.
<br>   “It is just as I feared,” he said, when he came back. “Sam <b>and</b> Pippin have trampled <b>the</b> soft ground, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> marks are spoilt <b>or</b> confused. Rangers have been here lately. It is they who left <b>the</b> firewood behind. But there are also several newer tracks that were not made <b>by</b> Rangers. At least one set was made, only a day <b>or</b> two ago, <b>by</b> heavy boots. At least one. I cannot now be certain, <b>but</b> I think there were many booted feet.” He paused <b>and</b> stood in anxious thought.
<br>   Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits saw in his mind a vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloaked <b>and</b> booted Riders. If <b>the</b> horsemen had already found <b>the</b> dell, <b>the</b> sooner Strider led them somewhere else <b>the</b> better. Sam viewed <b>the</b> hollow with great dislike, now that he had heard news <b>of</b> their enemies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road, only a few miles away.
<br>   “Hadn't we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?” he asked impatiently. “It is getting late, <b>and</b> I don't like this hole: <b>it</b> makes my heart sink somehow.”
<br>   “Yes, we certainly must decide what <b>to</b> do at once,” answered Strider, looking up <b>and</b> considering <b>the</b> time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weather. “Well, Sam,” he said at last, “I do not like this place either; <b>but</b> I cannot think <b>of</b> anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall. At least we are out <b>of</b> sight for <b>the</b> moment, <b>and</b> if we moved we should be much more likely <b>to</b> be seen <b>by</b> spies. All we could do would be <b>to</b> go right out <b>of</b> our way back north <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> hills, where <b>the</b> land is all much <b>the</b> same as <b>it</b> is here. The Road is watched, <b>but</b> we should have <b>to</b> cross <b>it</b>, if we tried <b>to</b> take cover in <b>the</b> thickets away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. On <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road beyond <b>the</b> hills <b>the</b> country is bare <b>and</b> flat for miles.”
<br>   “Can <b>the</b> Riders see?” asked Merry. “I mean, they seem usually <b>to</b> have used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is <b>the</b> right word, at least in <b>the</b> daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you saw them down below; <b>and</b> now you talk <b>of</b> being seen, if we move.”
<br>   “I was too careless <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top,” answered Strider. “I was very anxious <b>to</b> find some sign <b>of</b> Gandalf; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was a mistake for three <b>of</b> us <b>to</b> go up <b>and</b> stand there so long. For <b>the</b> black horses can see, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Riders can use men <b>and</b> other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They themselves do not see <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> light as we do, <b>but</b> our shapes cast shadows in their minds, which only <b>the</b> noon sun destroys; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> dark they perceive many signs <b>and</b> forms that are hidden from us: then they are most <b>to</b> be feared. And at all times they smell <b>the</b> blood <b>of</b> living things, desiring <b>and</b> hating <b>it</b>. Senses, too, there are other than sight <b>or</b> smell. We can feel their presence—<b>it</b> troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, <b>and</b> before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,” he added, <b>and</b> his voice sank <b>to</b> a whisper, “<b>the</b> Ring draws them.”
<br>   “Is there <b>no</b> escape then?” said Frodo, looking round wildly. “If I move I shall be seen <b>and</b> hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them <b>to</b> me!”
<br>   Strider laid his hand <b>on</b> his shoulder. “There is still hope,” he said. “You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set ready for <b>the</b> fire as a sign. There is little shelter <b>or</b> defence here, <b>but</b> fire shall serve for both. Sauron can put fire <b>to</b> his evil uses, as he can all things, <b>but</b> these Riders do not love <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> fear those who wield <b>it</b>. Fire is our friend in <b>the</b> wilderness.”
<br>   “Maybe,” muttered Sam. “It is also as good a way <b>of</b> saying “here we are” as I can think <b>of</b>, bar shouting.”
<br>   Down in <b>the</b> lowest <b>and</b> most sheltered corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell they lit a fire, <b>and</b> prepared a meal. The shades <b>of</b> evening began <b>to</b> fall, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> grew cold. They were suddenly aware <b>of</b> great hunger, for they had not eaten anything since breakfast; <b>but</b> they dared not make more than a frugal supper. The lands ahead were empty <b>of</b> all save birds <b>and</b> beasts, unfriendly places deserted <b>by</b> all <b>the</b> races <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Rangers passed at times beyond <b>the</b> hills, <b>but</b> they were few <b>and</b> did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains. Only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road would travellers be found, most often dwarves, hurrying along <b>on</b> business <b>of</b> their own, <b>and</b> with <b>no</b> help <b>and</b> few words <b>to</b> spare for strangers.
<br>   “I don't see how our food can be made <b>to</b> last,” said Frodo. “We have been careful enough in <b>the</b> last few days, <b>and</b> this supper is <b>no</b> feast; <b>but</b> we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still <b>to</b> go, <b>and</b> perhaps more.”
<br>   “There is food in <b>the</b> wild,” said Strider; “berry, root, <b>and</b> herb; <b>and</b> I have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid <b>of</b> starving before winter comes. But gathering <b>and</b> catching food is long <b>and</b> weary work, <b>and</b> we need haste. So tighten your belts, <b>and</b> think with hope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tables <b>of</b> Elrond's house!”
<br>   The cold increased as darkness came <b>on</b>. Peering out from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell they could see nothing <b>but</b> a grey land now vanishing quickly <b>into</b> shadow. The sky above had cleared again <b>and</b> was slowly filled with twinkling stars. Frodo <b>and</b> his companions huddled round <b>the</b> fire, wrapped in every garment <b>and</b> blanket they possessed; <b>but</b> Strider was content with a single cloak, <b>and</b> sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.
<br>   As night fell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire began <b>to</b> shine out brightly he began <b>to</b> tell them tales <b>to</b> keep their minds from fear. He knew many histories <b>and</b> legends <b>of</b> long ago, <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men <b>and</b> <b>the</b> good <b>and</b> evil deeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days. They wondered how old he was, <b>and</b> where he had learned all this lore.
<br>   “Tell us <b>of</b> Gil-galad,” said Merry suddenly, when he paused at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-Kingdoms. “Do you know any more <b>of</b> that old lay that you spoke <b>of</b>?”
<br>   “I do indeed,” answered Strider. “So also does Frodo, for <b>it</b> concerns us closely.” Merry <b>and</b> Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fire.
<br>   “I know only <b>the</b> little that Gandalf has told me,” said Frodo slowly. “Gil-galad was <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great Elf-kings <b>of</b> Middle-earth. Gil-galad is Starlight in their tongue. With Elendil, <b>the</b> Elf-friend, he went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b>—”
<br>   “No!” said Strider interrupting, “I do not think that tale should be told now with <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy at hand. If we win through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond, you may hear <b>it</b> there, told in full.”
<br>   “Then tell us some other tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old days,” begged Sam; “a tale about <b>the</b> Elves before <b>the</b> fading time. I would dearly like <b>to</b> hear more about Elves; <b>the</b> dark seems <b>to</b> press round so close.”
<br>   “I will tell you <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Tin?viel,” said Strider, “in brief—for <b>it</b> is a long tale <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> end is not known; <b>and</b> there are none now, except Elrond, that remember <b>it</b> aright as <b>it</b> was told <b>of</b> old. It is a fair tale, though <b>it</b> is sad, as are all <b>the</b> tales <b>of</b> Middle-earth, <b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> may lift up your hearts.” He was silent for some time, <b>and</b> then he began not <b>to</b> speak <b>but</b> <b>to</b> chant softly:
<br>   
<br>The leaves were long, <b>the</b> grass was green,
<br>The hemlock-umbels tall <b>and</b> fair,
<br>And in <b>the</b> glade a light was seen
<br>Of stars in shadow shimmering.
<br>Tin?viel was dancing there
<br>To music <b>of</b> a pipe unseen,
<br>And light <b>of</b> stars was in her hair,
<br>And in her raiment glimmering.
<br>
<br>There Beren came from mountains cold,
<br>And lost he wandered under leaves,
<br>And where <b>the</b> Elven-river rolled
<br>He walked alone <b>and</b> sorrowing.
<br>He peered between <b>the</b> hemlock-leaves
<br>And saw in wander flowers <b>of</b> gold
<br>Upon her mantle <b>and</b> her sleeves,
<br>And her hair like shadow following.
<br>
<br>Enchantment healed his weary feet
<br>That over hills were doomed <b>to</b> roam;
<br>And forth he hastened, strong <b>and</b> fleet,
<br>And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
<br>Through woven woods in Elvenhome
<br>She tightly fled <b>on</b> dancing feet,
<br>And left him lonely still <b>to</b> roam
<br>In <b>the</b> silent forest listening.
<br>
<br>He heard there oft <b>the</b> flying sound
<br>Of feet as light as linden-leaves,
<br>Or music welling underground,
<br>In hidden hollows quavering.
<br>Now withered lay <b>the</b> hemlock-sheaves,
<br>And one <b>by</b> one with sighing sound
<br>Whispering fell <b>the</b> beechen leaves
<br>In <b>the</b> wintry woodland wavering.
<br>
<br>He sought her ever, wandering far
<br>Where leaves <b>of</b> years were thickly strewn,
<br>By light <b>of</b> moon <b>and</b> ray <b>of</b> star
<br>In frosty heavens shivering.
<br>Her mantle glinted in <b>the</b> moon,
<br>As <b>on</b> a hill-top high <b>and</b> far
<br>She danced, <b>and</b> at her feet was strewn
<br>A mist <b>of</b> silver quivering.
<br>
<br>When winter passed, she came again,
<br>And her song released <b>the</b> sudden spring,
<br>Like rising lark, <b>and</b> falling rain,
<br>And melting water bubbling.
<br>He saw <b>the</b> elven-flowers spring
<br>About her feet, <b>and</b> healed again
<br>He longed <b>by</b> her <b>to</b> dance <b>and</b> sing
<br>Upon <b>the</b> grass untroubling.
<br>
<br>Again she fled, <b>but</b> swift he came.
<br>Tin?viel! Tin?viel!
<br>He called her <b>by</b> her elvish name;
<br>And there she halted listening.
<br>One moment stood she, <b>and</b> a spell
<br>His voice laid <b>on</b> her: Beren came,
<br>And doom fell <b>on</b> Tin?viel
<br>That in his arms lay glistening.
<br>
<br>As Beren looked <b>into</b> her eyes
<br>Within <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> her hair,
<br>The trembling starlight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skies
<br>He saw there mirrored shimmering.
<br>Tin?viel <b>the</b> elven-fair,
<br>Immortal maiden elven-wise,
<br>About him cast her shadowy hair
<br>And arms like silver glimmering.
<br>
<br>Long was <b>the</b> way that fate them bore,
<br>O'er stony mountains cold <b>and</b> grey,
<br>Through halls <b>of</b> iron <b>and</b> darkling door,
<br>And woods <b>of</b> nightshade morrowless.
<br>The Sundering Seas between them lay,
<br>And yet at last they met once more,
<br>And long ago they passed away
<br>In <b>the</b> forest singing sorrowless.
<br>   
<br>   Strider sighed <b>and</b> paused before he spoke again. “That is a song,” he said, “in <b>the</b> mode that is called ann-thennath among <b>the</b> Elves, <b>but</b> is hard <b>to</b> render in our Common Speech, <b>and</b> this is <b>but</b> a rough echo <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. It tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meeting <b>of</b> Beren son <b>of</b> Barahir <b>and</b> L?thien Tin?viel. Beren was a mortal man, <b>but</b> L?thien was <b>the</b> daughter <b>of</b> Thingol, a King <b>of</b> Elves upon Middle-earth when <b>the</b> world was young; <b>and</b> she was <b>the</b> fairest maiden that has ever been among all <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> this world. As <b>the</b> stars above <b>the</b> mists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern lands was her loveliness, <b>and</b> in her face was a shining light. In those days <b>the</b> Great Enemy, <b>of</b> whom Sauron <b>of</b> Mordor was <b>but</b> a servant, dwelt in Angband in <b>the</b> North, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West coming back <b>to</b> Middle-earth made war upon him <b>to</b> regain <b>the</b> Silmarils which he had stolen; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> Men aided <b>the</b> Elves. But <b>the</b> Enemy was victorious <b>and</b> Barahir was slain, <b>and</b> Beren escaping through great peril came over <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Terror <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hidden Kingdom <b>of</b> Thingol in <b>the</b> forest <b>of</b> Neldoreth. There he beheld L?thien singing <b>and</b> dancing in a glade beside <b>the</b> enchanted river Esgalduin; <b>and</b> he named her Tin?viel, that is Nightingale in <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, <b>and</b> they were parted long. Tin?viel rescued Beren from <b>the</b> dungeons <b>of</b> Sauron, <b>and</b> together they passed through great dangers, <b>and</b> cast down even <b>the</b> Great Enemy from his throne, <b>and</b> took from his iron crown one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three Silmarils, brightest <b>of</b> all jewels, <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> bride-price <b>of</b> L?thien <b>to</b> Thingol her father. Yet at <b>the</b> last Beren was slain <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wolf that came from <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> Angband, <b>and</b> he died in <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> Tin?viel. But she chose mortality, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> die from <b>the</b> world, so that she might follow him; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is sung that they met again beyond <b>the</b> Sundering Seas, <b>and</b> after a brief time walking alive once more in <b>the</b> green woods, together they passed, long ago, beyond <b>the</b> confines <b>of</b> this world. So <b>it</b> is that L?thien Tin?viel alone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-kindred has died indeed <b>and</b> left <b>the</b> world, <b>and</b> they have lost her whom they most loved. But from her <b>the</b> lineage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-lords <b>of</b> old descended among Men. There live still those <b>of</b> whom L?thien was <b>the</b> foremother, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond <b>of</b> Rivendell is <b>of</b> that Kin. For <b>of</b> Beren <b>and</b> L?thien was born Dior Thingol's heir; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> him Elwing <b>the</b> White whom E?rendil wedded, he that sailed his ship out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>into</b> <b>the</b> seas <b>of</b> heaven with <b>the</b> Silmaril upon his brow. And <b>of</b> E?rendil came <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> N?menor, that is Westernesse.”
<br>   As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit in <b>the</b> red glow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood-fire. His eyes shone, <b>and</b> his voice was rich <b>and</b> deep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over <b>the</b> crown <b>of</b> Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was climbing slowly above <b>the</b> hill that overshadowed them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stars above <b>the</b> hill-top faded.
<br>   The story ended. The hobbits moved <b>and</b> stretched. “Look!” said Merry. “The Moon is rising: <b>it</b> must be getting late.”
<br>   The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill something small <b>and</b> dark against <b>the</b> glimmer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moonrise. It was perhaps only a large stone <b>or</b> jutting rock shown up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pale light.
<br>   Sam <b>and</b> Merry got up <b>and</b> walked away from <b>the</b> fire. Frodo <b>and</b> Pippin remained seated in silence. Strider was watching <b>the</b> moonlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill intently. All seemed quiet <b>and</b> still, <b>but</b> Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that Strider was <b>no</b> longer speaking. He huddled closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire. At that moment Sam came running back from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell.
<br>   “I don't know what <b>it</b> is,” he said, “<b>but</b> I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn't go outside this dell for any money; I felt that something was creeping up <b>the</b> slope.”
<br>   “Did you see anything?” asked Frodo, springing <b>to</b> his feet.
<br>   “No, sir. I saw nothing, <b>but</b> I didn't stop <b>to</b> look.”
<br>   “I saw something,” said Merry; “<b>or</b> I thought I did—away westwards where <b>the</b> moonlight was falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flats beyond <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill-tops, I thought there were two <b>or</b> three black shapes. They seemed <b>to</b> be moving this way.”
<br>   “Keep close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire, with your faces outward!” cried Strider. “Get some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer sticks ready in your hands!”
<br>   For a breathless time they sat there, silent <b>and</b> alert, with their backs turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wood-fire, each gazing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows that encircled them. Nothing happened. There was <b>no</b> sound <b>or</b> movement in <b>the</b> night. Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break <b>the</b> silence: he longed <b>to</b> shout out aloud.
<br>   “Hush!” whispered Strider. “What's that?” gasped Pippin at <b>the</b> same moment.
<br>   Over <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little dell, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side away from <b>the</b> hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow <b>or</b> more than one. They strained their eyes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadows seemed <b>to</b> grow. Soon there could be <b>no</b> doubt:
<br>   three <b>or</b> four tall black figures were standing there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slope, looking down <b>on</b> them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in <b>the</b> deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as <b>of</b> venomous breath <b>and</b> felt a thin piercing chill. Then <b>the</b> shapes slowly advanced.
<br>   Terror overcame Pippin <b>and</b> Merry, <b>and</b> they threw themselves flat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Sam shrank <b>to</b> Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, <b>but</b> his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation <b>to</b> put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring. The desire <b>to</b> do this laid hold <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> he could think <b>of</b> nothing else. He did not forget <b>the</b> Barrow, nor <b>the</b> message <b>of</b> Gandalf; <b>but</b> something seemed <b>to</b> be compelling him <b>to</b> disregard all warnings, <b>and</b> he longed <b>to</b> yield. Not with <b>the</b> hope <b>of</b> escape, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> doing anything, either good <b>or</b> bad: he simply felt that he must take <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his finger. He could not speak. He felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble, <b>but</b> he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes <b>and</b> struggled for a while; <b>but</b> resistance became unbearable, <b>and</b> at last he slowly drew out <b>the</b> chain, <b>and</b> slipped <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forefinger <b>of</b> his left hand.
<br>   Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim <b>and</b> dark, <b>the</b> shapes became terribly clear. He was able <b>to</b> see beneath their black wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen <b>and</b> merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms <b>of</b> silver; in their haggard hands were swords <b>of</b> steel. Their eyes fell <b>on</b> him <b>and</b> pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own sword, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that <b>it</b> flickered red, as if <b>it</b> was a firebrand. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures halted. The third was taller than <b>the</b> others: his hair was long <b>and</b> gleaming <b>and</b> <b>on</b> his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a long sword, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> other a knife; both <b>the</b> knife <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hand that held <b>it</b> glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward <b>and</b> bore down <b>on</b> Frodo.
<br>   At that moment Frodo threw himself forward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> he heard himself crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At <b>the</b> same time he struck at <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in <b>the</b> night; <b>and</b> he felt a pain like a dart <b>of</b> poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse <b>of</b> Strider leaping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness with a flaming brand <b>of</b> wood in either hand. With a last effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped <b>the</b> Ring from his finger <b>and</b> closed his right hand tight upon <b>it</b>.

<br>Chapter 12
<br>FLIGHT TO THE FORD
<br>
<br>   When Frodo came <b>to</b> himself he was still clutching <b>the</b> Ring desperately. He was lying <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire, which was now piled high <b>and</b> burning brightly. His three companions were bending over him. “What has happened? Where is <b>the</b> pale king?” he asked wildly. They were too overjoyed <b>to</b> hear him speak <b>to</b> answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly <b>to</b> his horror Sam found that his master had vanished; <b>and</b> at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, <b>and</b> he fell. He heard Frodo's voice, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> come from a great distance, <b>or</b> from under <b>the</b> earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they stumbled over <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them <b>to</b> pick him up <b>and</b> lay him near <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> then he disappeared. That was now a good while ago.
<br>   Sam plainly was beginning <b>to</b> have doubts again about Strider; <b>but</b> while they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows. They started, <b>and</b> Sam drew his sword <b>and</b> stood over Frodo; <b>but</b> Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.
<br>   “I am not a Black Rider, Sam,” he said gently, “nor in league with them. I have been trying <b>to</b> discover something <b>of</b> their movements; <b>but</b> I have found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone <b>and</b> do not attack again. But there is <b>no</b> feeling <b>of</b> their presence anywhere at hand.”
<br>   When he heard what Frodo had <b>to</b> tell, he became full <b>of</b> concern, <b>and</b> shook his head <b>and</b> sighed. Then he ordered Pippin <b>and</b> Merry <b>to</b> heat as much water as they could in their small kettles, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> bathe <b>the</b> wound with <b>it</b>. “Keep <b>the</b> fire going well, <b>and</b> keep Frodo warm!” he said. Then he got up <b>and</b> walked away, <b>and</b> called Sam <b>to</b> him. “I think I understand things better now,” he said in a low voice. “There seem only <b>to</b> have been five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy. Why they were not all here, I don't know; <b>but</b> I don't think they expected <b>to</b> be resisted. They have drawn off for <b>the</b> time being. But not far, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him <b>to</b> their will. We shall see!” Sam choked with tears. “Don't despair!” said Strider. “You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made <b>of</b> sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that <b>it</b> might prove so. He is not slain, <b>and</b> I think he will resist <b>the</b> evil power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wound longer than his enemies expect. I will do all I can <b>to</b> help <b>and</b> heal him. Guard him well, while I am away!” He hurried off <b>and</b> disappeared again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   Frodo dozed, though <b>the</b> pain <b>of</b> his wound was slowly growing, <b>and</b> a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder <b>to</b> his arm <b>and</b> side. His friends watched over him, warming him, <b>and</b> bathing his wound. The night passed slowly <b>and</b> wearily. Dawn was growing in <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.
<br>   “Look!” he cried; <b>and</b> stooping he lifted from <b>the</b> ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden <b>by</b> <b>the</b> darkness. A foot above <b>the</b> lower hem there was a slash. “This was <b>the</b> stroke <b>of</b> Frodo's sword,” he said. “The only hurt that <b>it</b> did <b>to</b> his enemy, I fear; for <b>it</b> is unharmed, <b>but</b> all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly <b>to</b> him was <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Elbereth.”
<br>   “And more deadly <b>to</b> Frodo was this!” He stooped again <b>and</b> lifted up a long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in <b>it</b>. As Strider raised <b>it</b> they saw that near <b>the</b> end its edge was notched <b>and</b> <b>the</b> point was broken off. But even as he held <b>it</b> up in <b>the</b> growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for <b>the</b> blade seemed <b>to</b> melt, <b>and</b> vanished like a smoke in <b>the</b> air, leaving only <b>the</b> hilt in Strider's hand. “Alas!” he cried. “It was this accursed knife that gave <b>the</b> wound. Few now have <b>the</b> skill in healing <b>to</b> match such evil weapons. But I will do what I can.”
<br>   He sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> taking <b>the</b> dagger-hilt laid <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his knees, <b>and</b> he sang over <b>it</b> a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting <b>it</b> aside, he turned <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> in a soft tone spoke words <b>the</b> others could not catch. From <b>the</b> pouch at his belt he drew out <b>the</b> long leaves <b>of</b> a plant.
<br>   “These leaves,” he said, “I have walked far <b>to</b> find; for this plant does not grow in <b>the</b> bare hills; <b>but</b> in <b>the</b> thickets away south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road I found <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> dark <b>by</b> <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> its leaves.” He crushed a leaf in his fingers, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> gave out a sweet <b>and</b> pungent fragrance. “It is fortunate that I could find <b>it</b>, for <b>it</b> is a healing plant that <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West brought <b>to</b> Middle-earth. Athelas they named <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> grows now sparsely <b>and</b> only near places where they dwelt <b>or</b> camped <b>of</b> old; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is not known in <b>the</b> North, except <b>to</b> some <b>of</b> those who wander in <b>the</b> Wild. It has great virtues, <b>but</b> over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.”
<br>   He threw <b>the</b> leaves <b>into</b> boiling water <b>and</b> bathed Frodo's shoulder. The fragrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam was refreshing, <b>and</b> those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed <b>and</b> cleared. The herb had also some power over <b>the</b> wound, for Frodo felt <b>the</b> pain <b>and</b> also <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> frozen cold lessen in his side; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> life did not return <b>to</b> his arm, <b>and</b> he could not raise <b>or</b> use his hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, <b>and</b> reproached himself for weakness <b>of</b> will; for he now perceived that in putting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring he obeyed not his own desire <b>but</b> <b>the</b> commanding wish <b>of</b> his enemies. He wondered if he would remain maimed for life, <b>and</b> how they would now manage <b>to</b> continue their journey. He fell too weak <b>to</b> stand.
<br>   The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided <b>to</b> leave Weathertop as soon as possible. “I think now,” said Strider, “that <b>the</b> enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced <b>to</b> ride away, <b>and</b> he will not return. In any case we are in great peril here after dark, since <b>the</b> attack <b>of</b> last night, <b>and</b> we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.”
<br>   As soon as <b>the</b> daylight was full, they had some hurried food <b>and</b> packed. It was impossible for Frodo <b>to</b> walk, so they divided <b>the</b> greater part <b>of</b> their baggage among <b>the</b> four <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> put Frodo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pony. In <b>the</b> last few days <b>the</b> poor beast had improved wonderfully; <b>it</b> already seemed fatter <b>and</b> stronger, <b>and</b> had begun <b>to</b> show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must have been very hard for <b>the</b> journey in <b>the</b> wild <b>to</b> seem so much better than its former life.
<br>   They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing <b>the</b> Road, <b>but</b>. <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> quickest way <b>to</b> more wooded country. And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all. It was also his plan <b>to</b> shorten their journey <b>by</b> cutting across another great loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road: east beyond Weathertop <b>it</b> changed its course <b>and</b> took a wide bend northwards.
<br>   They made their way slowly <b>and</b> cautiously round <b>the</b> south-western slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> came in a little while <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. There was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling <b>and</b> a cold voice answering. Trembling they sprang forward, <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> thickets that lay ahead. The land before them sloped away southwards, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was wild <b>and</b> pathless; bushes <b>and</b> stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between. The grass was scanty, coarse, <b>and</b> grey; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaves in <b>the</b> thickets were faded <b>and</b> falling. It was a cheerless land, <b>and</b> their journey was slow <b>and</b> gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, <b>and</b> their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed tired <b>and</b> heavy-hearted.
<br>   Before <b>the</b> first day's march was over Frodo's pain began <b>to</b> grow again, <b>but</b> he did not speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b> for a long time. Four days passed, without <b>the</b> ground <b>or</b> <b>the</b> scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank, <b>and</b> before them <b>the</b> distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet since that far cry they had seen <b>and</b> heard <b>no</b> sign that <b>the</b> enemy had marked their flight <b>or</b> followed them. They dreaded <b>the</b> dark hours, <b>and</b> kept watch in pairs <b>by</b> night, expecting at any time <b>to</b> see black shapes stalking in <b>the</b> grey night, dimly lit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cloud-veiled moon; <b>but</b> they saw nothing, <b>and</b> heard <b>no</b> sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sigh <b>of</b> withered leaves <b>and</b> grass. Not once did they feel <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> present evil that had assailed them before <b>the</b> attack in <b>the</b> dell. It seemed too much <b>to</b> hope that <b>the</b> Riders had already lost their trail again. Perhaps they were waiting <b>to</b> make some ambush in a narrow place?
<br>   At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth day <b>the</b> ground began once more <b>to</b> rise slowly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide shallow valley <b>into</b> which they had descended. Strider now turned their course again north-eastwards, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sixth day they reached <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a long slow-climbing slope, <b>and</b> saw far ahead a huddle <b>of</b> wooded hills. Away below them they could see <b>the</b> Road sweeping round <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their right a grey river gleamed pale in <b>the</b> thin sunshine. In <b>the</b> distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half-veiled in mist.
<br>   "I am afraid we must go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road here for a while,” said Strider. “We have now come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River Hoarwell, that <b>the</b> Elves call Mitheithel. It flows down out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ettenmoors, <b>the</b> troll-fells north <b>of</b> Rivendell, <b>and</b> joins <b>the</b> Loudwater away in <b>the</b> South. Some call <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood after that. It is a great water before <b>it</b> finds <b>the</b> Sea. There is <b>no</b> way over <b>it</b> below its sources in <b>the</b> Ettenmoors, except <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Last Bridge <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> Road crosses.”
<br>   “What is that other river we can see far away there?” asked Merry.
<br>   “That is Loudwater, <b>the</b> Bruinen <b>of</b> Rivendell,” answered Strider. “The Road runs along <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills for many miles from <b>the</b> Bridge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find <b>the</b> Last Bridge held against us.”
<br>   Next day, early in <b>the</b> morning, they came down again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. Sam <b>and</b> Strider went forward, <b>but</b> they found <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> any travellers <b>or</b> riders. Here under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills there had been some rain. Strider judged that <b>it</b> had fallen two days before, <b>and</b> had washed away all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.
<br>   They hurried along with all <b>the</b> speed they could make, <b>and</b> after a mile <b>or</b> two they saw <b>the</b> Last Bridge ahead, at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a short steep slope. They dreaded <b>to</b> see black figures waiting there, <b>but</b> they saw none. Strider made them take cover in a thicket at <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, while he went forward <b>to</b> explore.
<br>   Before long he came hurrying back. “I can see <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy,” he said, “<b>and</b> I wonder very much what that means. But I have found something very strange.”
<br>   He held out his hand, <b>and</b> showed a single pale-green jewel. “I found <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> mud in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bridge,” he said. “It is a beryl, an elf-stone. Whether <b>it</b> was set there, <b>or</b> let fall <b>by</b> chance, I cannot say; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> brings hope <b>to</b> me. I will take <b>it</b> as a sign that we may pass <b>the</b> Bridge; <b>but</b> beyond that I dare not keep <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road, without some clearer token.”
<br>   At once they went <b>on</b> again. They crossed <b>the</b> Bridge in safety, hearing <b>no</b> sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> water swirling against its three great arches. A mile further <b>on</b> they came <b>to</b> a narrow ravine that led away northwards through <b>the</b> steep lands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. Here Strider turned aside, <b>and</b> soon they were lost in a sombre country <b>of</b> dark trees winding among <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> sullen hills.
<br>   The hobbits were glad <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> cheerless lands <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perilous Road behind them; <b>but</b> this new country seemed threatening <b>and</b> unfriendly. As they went forward <b>the</b> hills about them steadily rose. Here <b>and</b> there upon heights <b>and</b> ridges they caught glimpses <b>of</b> ancient walls <b>of</b> stone, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had time <b>to</b> gaze ahead <b>and</b> <b>to</b> think. He recalled Bilbo's account <b>of</b> his journey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> threatening towers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, in <b>the</b> country near <b>the</b> Troll's wood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo guessed that they were now in <b>the</b> same region, <b>and</b> wondered if <b>by</b> chance they would pass near <b>the</b> spot.
<br>   “Who lives in this land?” he asked. “And who built these towers? Is this troll-country?”
<br>   “No!” said Strider. “Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land. Men once dwelt here, ages ago; <b>but</b> none remain now. They became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> Angmar. But all were destroyed in <b>the</b> war that brought <b>the</b> North Kingdom <b>to</b> its end. But that is now so long ago that <b>the</b> hills have forgotten them, though a shadow still lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land.”
<br>   “Where did you learn such tales, if all <b>the</b> land is empty <b>and</b> forgetful?” asked Peregrin. “The birds <b>and</b> beasts do not tell tales <b>of</b> that son.”
<br>   “The heirs <b>of</b> Elendil do not forget all things past,” said Strider; “<b>and</b> many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell.” “Have you often been <b>to</b> Rivendell?” said Frodo. “I have,” said Strider. “I dwelt there once, <b>and</b> still I return when I may.
<br>   There my heart is; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is not my fate <b>to</b> sit in peace, even in <b>the</b> fair house <b>of</b> Elrond.”
<br>   The hills now began <b>to</b> shut them in. The Road behind held <b>on</b> its way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River Bruinen, <b>but</b> both were now hidden from view. The travellers came <b>into</b> a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark <b>and</b> silent. Trees with old <b>and</b> twisted roots hung over cliffs, <b>and</b> piled up behind <b>into</b> mounting slopes <b>of</b> pine-wood.
<br>   The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had <b>to</b> pick their way through a pathless country, encumbered <b>by</b> fallen trees <b>and</b> tumbled rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo's sake, <b>and</b> because <b>it</b> was in fact difficult <b>to</b> find any way up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrow dales. They had been two days in this country when <b>the</b> weather turned wet. The wind began <b>to</b> blow steadily out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> pour <b>the</b> water <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distant seas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dark heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall they were all soaked, <b>and</b> their camp was cheerless, for they could not get any fire <b>to</b> burn. The next day <b>the</b> hills rose still higher <b>and</b> steeper before them, <b>and</b> they were forced <b>to</b> turn away northwards out <b>of</b> their course. Strider seemed <b>to</b> be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, <b>and</b> their stock <b>of</b> provisions was beginning <b>to</b> run low. It went <b>on</b> raining.
<br>   That night they camped <b>on</b> a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in <b>the</b> cliff. Frodo was restless. The cold <b>and</b> wet had made his wound more painful than ever, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ache <b>and</b> sense <b>of</b> deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing <b>and</b> turning <b>and</b> listening fearfully <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks <b>of</b> rock, water dripping, a crack, <b>the</b> sudden rattling fall <b>of</b> a loosened stone. He felt that black shapes were advancing <b>to</b> smother him; <b>but</b> when he sat up he saw nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> Strider sitting hunched up, smoking his pipe, <b>and</b> watching. He lay down again <b>and</b> passed <b>into</b> an uneasy dream, in which he walked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass in his garden in <b>the</b> Shire, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed faint <b>and</b> dim, less clear than <b>the</b> tall black shadows that stood looking over <b>the</b> hedge.
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning he woke <b>to</b> find that <b>the</b> rain had stopped. The clouds were still thick, <b>but</b> they were breaking, <b>and</b> pale strips <b>of</b> blue appeared between them. The wind was shifting again. They did not start early. Immediately after their cold <b>and</b> comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone, telling <b>the</b> others <b>to</b> remain under <b>the</b> shelter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff, until he came back. He was going <b>to</b> climb up, if he could, <b>and</b> get a look at <b>the</b> lie <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land.
<br>   When he returned he was not reassuring. “We have come too far <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north,” he said, “<b>and</b> we must find some way <b>to</b> turn back southwards again. If we keep <b>on</b> as we are going we shall get up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ettendales far north <b>of</b> Rivendell. That is troll-country, <b>and</b> little known <b>to</b> me. We could perhaps find our way through <b>and</b> come round <b>to</b> Rivendell from <b>the</b> north; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> would take too long, for I do not know <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> our food would not last. So somehow <b>or</b> other we must find <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen.”
<br>   The rest <b>of</b> that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They found a passage between two hills that led them <b>into</b> a valley running south-east, <b>the</b> direction that they wished <b>to</b> take; <b>but</b> towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day they found their road again barred <b>by</b> a ridge <b>of</b> high land; its dark edge against <b>the</b> sky was broken <b>into</b> many bare points like teeth <b>of</b> a blunted saw. They had a choice between going back <b>or</b> climbing over <b>it</b>.
<br>   They decided <b>to</b> attempt <b>the</b> climb, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> proved very difficult. Before long Frodo was obliged <b>to</b> dismount <b>and</b> struggle along <b>on</b> foot. Even so they often despaired <b>of</b> getting their pony up, <b>or</b> indeed <b>of</b> finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, <b>and</b> they were all exhausted, when at last they reached <b>the</b> top. They had climbed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a narrow saddle between two higher points, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, <b>and</b> lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, <b>and</b> his side <b>and</b> shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees <b>and</b> rocks about him seemed shadowy <b>and</b> dim.
<br>   “We cannot go any further,” said Merry <b>to</b> Strider. “I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we <b>to</b> do? Do you think they will be able <b>to</b> cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?”
<br>   “We shall see,” answered Strider. “There is nothing more that I can do in <b>the</b> wilderness; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is chiefly because <b>of</b> his wound that I am so anxious <b>to</b> press <b>on</b>. But I agree that we can go <b>no</b> further tonight.”
<br>   “What is <b>the</b> matter with my master?” asked Sam in a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider. “His wound was small, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is already closed. There's nothing <b>to</b> be seen <b>but</b> a cold white mark <b>on</b> his shoulder.”
<br>   “Frodo has been touched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weapons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy,” said Strider, “<b>and</b> there is some poison <b>or</b> evil at work that is beyond my skill <b>to</b> drive out. But do not give up hope, Sam!”
<br>   Night was cold up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high ridge. They lit a small fire down under <b>the</b> gnarled roots <b>of</b> an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: <b>it</b> looked as if stone had once been quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill through <b>the</b> pass, <b>and</b> they heard <b>the</b> tree-tops lower down moaning <b>and</b> sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping <b>by</b> above him, <b>and</b> that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wings rode pursuers that sought him in all <b>the</b> hollows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills.
<br>   The morning dawned bright <b>and</b> fair; <b>the</b> air was clean, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light pale <b>and</b> clear in a rain-washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, <b>but</b> (hey longed for <b>the</b> sun <b>to</b> warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as <b>it</b> was light, Strider took Merry with him <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> survey <b>the</b> country from <b>the</b> height <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass. The sun had risen <b>and</b> was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news. They were now going more <b>or</b> less in <b>the</b> right direction. If they went <b>on</b>, down <b>the</b> further side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge, they would have <b>the</b> Mountains <b>on</b> their left. Some way ahead Strider had caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loudwater again, <b>and</b> he knew that, though <b>it</b> was hidden from view, <b>the</b> Road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford was not far from <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side nearest <b>to</b> them.
<br>   “We must make for <b>the</b> Road again,” he said. “We cannot hope <b>to</b> find a path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset <b>it</b>, <b>the</b> Road is our only way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford.”
<br>   As soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down <b>the</b> southern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> way was much easier than they had expected, for <b>the</b> slope was far less steep <b>on</b> this side, <b>and</b> before long Frodo was able <b>to</b> ride again. Bill Ferny's poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, <b>and</b> for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible. The spirits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party rose again. Even Frodo felt better in <b>the</b> morning light, <b>but</b> every now <b>and</b> again a mist seemed <b>to</b> obscure his sight, <b>and</b> he passed his hands over his eyes.
<br>   Pippin was a little ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others. Suddenly he turned round <b>and</b> called <b>to</b> them. “There is a path here!” he cried.
<br>   When they came up with him, they saw that he had made <b>no</b> mistake:
<br>   there were clearly <b>the</b> beginnings <b>of</b> a path, that climbed with many windings out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods below <b>and</b> faded away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top behind. In places <b>it</b> was now faint <b>and</b> overgrown, <b>or</b> choked with fallen stones <b>and</b> trees; <b>but</b> at one time <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> have been much used. It was a path made <b>by</b> strong arms <b>and</b> heavy feet. Here <b>and</b> there old trees had been cut <b>or</b> broken down, <b>and</b> large rocks cloven <b>or</b> heaved aside <b>to</b> make a way.
<br>   They followed <b>the</b> track for some while, for <b>it</b> offered much <b>the</b> easiest way down, <b>but</b> they went cautiously, <b>and</b> their anxiety increased as they came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark woods, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> path grew plainer <b>and</b> broader. Suddenly coming out <b>of</b> a belt <b>of</b> fir-trees <b>it</b> ran steeply down a slope, <b>and</b> turned sharply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left round <b>the</b> comer <b>of</b> a rocky shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. When they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> comer they looked round <b>and</b> saw that <b>the</b> path ran <b>on</b> over a level strip under <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> a low cliff overhung with trees. In <b>the</b> stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge.
<br>   Outside <b>the</b> door they all halted. There was a cave <b>or</b> rock-chamber behind, <b>but</b> in <b>the</b> gloom inside nothing could be seen. Strider, Sam, <b>and</b> Merry pushing with all their strength managed <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> door a little wider, <b>and</b> then Strider <b>and</b> Merry went in. They did not go far, for <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor lay many old bones, <b>and</b> nothing else was <b>to</b> be seen near <b>the</b> entrance except some great empty jars <b>and</b> broken pots.
<br>   “Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!” said Pippin. “Come out, you two, <b>and</b> let us get away. Now we know who made <b>the</b> path -<b>and</b> we had better get off <b>it</b> quick.”
<br>   “There is <b>no</b> need, I think,” said Strider, coining out. “It is certainly a troll-hole, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> have been long forsaken. I don't think we need be afraid. But let us go <b>on</b> down warily, <b>and</b> we shall see.”
<br>   The path went <b>on</b> again from <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right again across <b>the</b> level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking <b>to</b> show Strider that he was still afraid, went <b>on</b> ahead with Merry. Sam <b>and</b> Strider came behind, one <b>on</b> each side <b>of</b> Frodo's pony, for <b>the</b> path was now broad enough for four <b>or</b> five hobbits <b>to</b> walk abreast. But they had not gone very far before Pippin came running back, followed <b>by</b> Merry. They both looked terrified.
<br>   “There are trolls!” Pippin panted. “Down in a clearing in <b>the</b> woods not far below. We got a sight <b>of</b> them through <b>the</b> tree-trunks. They are very large!”
<br>   “We will come <b>and</b> look at them,” said Strider, picking up a stick. Frodo said nothing, <b>but</b> Sam looked scared.
<br>   The sun was now high, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> shone down through <b>the</b> half-stripped branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> lit <b>the</b> clearing with bright patches <b>of</b> light. They halted suddenly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge, <b>and</b> peered through <b>the</b> tree-trunks, holding their breath. There stood <b>the</b> trolls: three large trolls. One was stooping, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other two stood staring at him.
<br>   Strider walked forward unconcernedly. “Get up, old stone!” he said, <b>and</b> broke his stick upon <b>the</b> stooping troll.
<br>   Nothing happened. There was a gasp <b>of</b> astonishment from <b>the</b> hobbits, <b>and</b> then even Frodo laughed. “Well!” he said. “We are forgetting our family history! These must be <b>the</b> very three that were caught <b>by</b> Gandalf, quarrelling over <b>the</b> right way <b>to</b> cook thirteen dwarves <b>and</b> one hobbit.”
<br>   “I had <b>no</b> idea we were anywhere near <b>the</b> place!” said Pippin. He knew <b>the</b> story well. Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo had told <b>it</b> often; <b>but</b> as a matter <b>of</b> fact he had never more than half believed <b>it</b>. Even now he looked at <b>the</b> stone trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them <b>to</b> life again.
<br>   “You are forgetting not only your family history, <b>but</b> all you ever knew about trolls,” said Strider. “It is broad daylight with a bright sun, <b>and</b> yet you come back trying <b>to</b> scare me with a tale <b>of</b> live trolls waiting for us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one <b>of</b> them has an old bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll!”
<br>   They all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: <b>the</b> reminder <b>of</b> Bilbo's first successful adventure was heartening. The sun, too, was warm <b>and</b> comforting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mist before his eyes seemed <b>to</b> be lifting a little. They rested for some time in <b>the</b> glade, <b>and</b> took their mid-day meal right under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trolls” large legs.
<br>   “Won't somebody give us a bit <b>of</b> a song, while <b>the</b> sun is high?” said Merry, when they had finished. “We haven't had a song <b>or</b> a tale for days.”
<br>   “Not since Weathertop,” said Frodo. The others looked at him. “Don't worry about me!” he added. “I feel much better, <b>but</b> I don't think I could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out <b>of</b> his memory.”
<br>   “Come <b>on</b>, Sam!” said Merry. “There's more stored in your head than you let <b>on</b> about.”
<br>   “I don't know about that,” said Sam. “But how would this suit? It ain't what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit <b>of</b> nonsense. But these old images here brought <b>it</b> <b>to</b> my mind.” Standing up, with his hands behind his back, as if he was at school, he began <b>to</b> sing <b>to</b> an old tune.
<br>   
<br>Troll sat alone <b>on</b> his seat <b>of</b> stone,
<br>And munched <b>and</b> mumbled a bare old bone;
<br>For many a year he had gnawed <b>it</b> near,
<br>For meat was hard <b>to</b> come <b>by</b>.
<br>Done <b>by</b>! Gum <b>by</b>!
<br>In a case in <b>the</b> hills he dwelt alone,
<br>And meat was hard <b>to</b> come <b>by</b>.
<br>
<br>Up came Tom with his big boots <b>on</b>.
<br>Said he <b>to</b> Troll: “Pray, what is yon?
<br>For <b>it</b> looks like <b>the</b> shin o” my nuncle Tim,
<br>As should be a-lyin” in graveyard.
<br>Caveyard! Paveyard!
<br>This many a year has Tim been gone,
<br>And I thought he were lyin” in graveyard.'
<br>
<br>'My lad,” said Troll, “this bone I stole.
<br>But what be bones that lie in a hole?
<br>Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o” lead,
<br>Afore I found his shinbone.
<br>Tinbone! Thinbone!
<br>He can spare a share for a poor old troll,
<br>For he don't need his shinbone.'
<br>
<br>Said Tom: “I don't see why <b>the</b> likes o” thee
<br>Without axin” leave should go makin” free
<br>With <b>the</b> shank <b>or</b> <b>the</b> shin o” my father's kin;
<br>So hand <b>the</b> old bone over!
<br>Rover! Trover!
<br>Though dead he be, <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> he;
<br>So hand <b>the</b> old bone over!'
<br>
<br>'For a couple o” pins,” says Troll, <b>and</b> grins,
<br>'I'll eat thee too, <b>and</b> gnaw thy shins.
<br>A bit o” fresh meal will go down sweet!
<br>I'll try my teeth <b>on</b> thee now.
<br>Hee now! See now!
<br>I'm tired o” gnawing old bones <b>and</b> skins;
<br>I've a mind <b>to</b> dine <b>on</b> thee now.'
<br>
<br>But just as he thought his dinner was caught,
<br>He found his hands had hold <b>of</b> naught.
<br>Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind
<br>And gave him <b>the</b> boot <b>to</b> larn him.
<br>Warn him! Darn him!
<br>A bump o” <b>the</b> boot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat, Tom thought,
<br>Would be <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> larn him.
<br>
<br>But harder than stone is <b>the</b> flesh <b>and</b> bone
<br>Of a troll that sits in <b>the</b> hills alone.
<br>As well set your boot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain's root,
<br>For <b>the</b> seat <b>of</b> a troll don't feel <b>it</b>.
<br>Peel <b>it</b>! Heal <b>it</b>!
<br>Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan,
<br>And he knew his toes could feel <b>it</b>.
<br>
<br>Tom's leg is game, since home he came,
<br>And his bootless foot is lasting lame;
<br>But Troll don't care, <b>and</b> he's still there
<br>With <b>the</b> bone he boned from its owner.
<br>Doner! Boner!
<br>Troll's old seat is still <b>the</b> same,
<br>And <b>the</b> bone he boned from its owner!
<br>   
<br>   “Well, that's a warning <b>to</b> us all!” laughed Merry. “It is as well you used a stick, <b>and</b> not your hand, Strider!”
<br>   “Where did you come <b>by</b> that, Sam?” asked Pippin. “I've never heard those words before.”
<br>   Sam muttered something inaudible. “It's out <b>of</b> his own head, <b>of</b> course,” said Frodo. “I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee <b>on</b> this journey. First he was a conspirator, now he's a jester. He'll end up <b>by</b> becoming a wizard—<b>or</b> a warrior!”
<br>   “I hope not,” said Sam. “I don't want <b>to</b> be neither!”
<br>   In <b>the</b> afternoon they went <b>on</b> down <b>the</b> woods. They were probably following <b>the</b> very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dwarves had used many years before. After a few miles they came out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a high bank above <b>the</b> Road. At this point <b>the</b> Road had left <b>the</b> Hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley, <b>and</b> now clung close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, rolling <b>and</b> winding eastward among woods <b>and</b> heather-covered slopes towards <b>the</b> Ford <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountains. Not far down <b>the</b> bank Strider pointed out a stone in <b>the</b> grass. On <b>it</b> roughly cut <b>and</b> now much weathered could still be seen dwarf-runes <b>and</b> secret marks.
<br>   “There!” said Merry. “That must be <b>the</b> stone that marked <b>the</b> place where <b>the</b> trolls” gold was hidden. How much is left <b>of</b> Bilbo's share, I wonder, Frodo?”
<br>   Frodo looked at <b>the</b> stone, <b>and</b> wished that Bilbo had brought home <b>no</b> treasure more perilous, nor less easy <b>to</b> pan with. “None at all,” he said. “Bilbo gave <b>it</b> all away. He told me he did not feel <b>it</b> was really his, as <b>it</b> came from robbers.”
<br>   The Road lay quiet under <b>the</b> long shadows <b>of</b> early evening. There was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> any other travellers <b>to</b> be seen. As there was now <b>no</b> other possible course for them <b>to</b> take, they climbed down <b>the</b> bank, <b>and</b> turning left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills cut off <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down <b>to</b> meet them from <b>the</b> mountains ahead.
<br>   They were beginning <b>to</b> look out for a place off <b>the</b> Road, where they could camp for <b>the</b> night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back <b>into</b> their hearts: <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> hoofs behind them. They looked back, <b>but</b> they could not see far because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many windings <b>and</b> rollings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off <b>the</b> beaten way <b>and</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep heather <b>and</b> bilberry brushwood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slopes above, until they came <b>to</b> a small patch <b>of</b> thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among <b>the</b> bushes, they could see <b>the</b> Road, faint <b>and</b> grey in <b>the</b> failing light, some thirty feel below them. The sound <b>of</b> hoofs drew nearer. They were going fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly, as if <b>it</b> was blown away from them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> breeze, they seemed <b>to</b> catch a dim ringing, as <b>of</b> small bells tinkling.
<br>   “That does not sound like a Black Rider's horse!” said Frodo, listening intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that <b>it</b> did not, <b>but</b> they all remained full <b>of</b> suspicion. They had been in fear <b>of</b> pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous <b>and</b> unfriendly. But Strider was now leaning forward, stooped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, with a hand <b>to</b> his ear, <b>and</b> a look <b>of</b> joy <b>on</b> his face.
<br>   The light faded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bushes rustled softly. Clearer <b>and</b> nearer now <b>the</b> bells jingled, <b>and</b> clippety-clip came <b>the</b> quick trotting feet. Suddenly <b>into</b> view below came a white horse, gleaming in <b>the</b> shadows, running swiftly. In <b>the</b> dusk its headstall flickered <b>and</b> flashed, as if <b>it</b> were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, <b>and</b> his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in <b>the</b> wind <b>of</b> his speed. To Frodo <b>it</b> appeared that a white light was shining through <b>the</b> form <b>and</b> raiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider, as if through a thin veil.
<br>   Strider sprang from hiding <b>and</b> dashed down towards <b>the</b> Road, leaping with a cry through <b>the</b> heather; <b>but</b> even before he had moved <b>or</b> called, <b>the</b> rider had reined in his horse <b>and</b> halted, looking up towards <b>the</b> thicket where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted <b>and</b> ran <b>to</b> meet him calling out: Ai na vedui D?nadan! Mae govannen! His speech <b>and</b> clear ringing voice left <b>no</b> doubt in their hearts: <b>the</b> rider was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-folk. No others that dwelt in <b>the</b> wide world had voices so fair <b>to</b> hear. But there seemed <b>to</b> be a note <b>of</b> haste <b>or</b> fear in his call, <b>and</b> they saw that he was now speaking quickly <b>and</b> urgently <b>to</b> Strider.
<br>   Soon Strider beckoned <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits left <b>the</b> bushes <b>and</b> hurried down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road. “This is Glorfindel, who dwells in <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond,” said Strider.
<br>   “Hail, <b>and</b> well met at last!” said <b>the</b> Elf-lord <b>to</b> Frodo. “I was sent from Rivendell <b>to</b> look for you. We feared that you were in danger upon <b>the</b> road.”
<br>   “Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?” cried Frodo joyfully.
<br>   “No. He had not when I departed; <b>but</b> that was nine days ago,” answered Glorfindel. “Elrond received news that troubled him. Some <b>of</b> my kindred, journeying in your land beyond <b>the</b> Baranduin,* learned that things were amiss, <b>and</b> sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that <b>the</b> Nine were abroad, <b>and</b> that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against <b>the</b> Nine; <b>but</b> such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, <b>and</b> south. It was thought that you might turn far aside <b>to</b> avoid pursuit, <b>and</b> become lost in <b>the</b> Wilderness.
<br>   “It was my lot <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> I came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bridge <b>of</b> Mitheithel, <b>and</b> left a token there, nigh <b>on</b> seven days ago. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> Sauron were upon <b>the</b> Bridge, <b>but</b> they withdrew <b>and</b> I pursued them westward. I came also upon two others, <b>but</b> they turned away southward. Since then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b> over <b>the</b> Bridge; <b>and</b> today I marked where you descended from <b>the</b> hills again. But come! There is <b>no</b> time for further news. Since you are here we must risk <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road <b>and</b> go. There are five behind us, <b>and</b> when they find your trail upon <b>the</b> Road they will ride after us like <b>the</b> wind. And they are not all. Where <b>the</b> other four may be, I do not know. I fear that we may find <b>the</b> Ford is already held against us.”
<br>   While Glorfindel was speaking <b>the</b> shades <b>of</b> evening deepened. Frodo felt a great weariness come over him. Ever since <b>the</b> sun began <b>to</b> sink <b>the</b> mist before his eyes had darkened, <b>and</b> he felt that a shadow was coming between him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> his friends. Now pain assailed him, <b>and</b> he felt cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm.
<br>   “My master is sick <b>and</b> wounded,” said Sam angrily. “He can't go <b>on</b> riding after nightfall. He needs rest.”
<br>   Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.
<br>   Briefly Strider told <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack <b>on</b> their camp under Weathertop, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deadly knife. He drew out <b>the</b> hilt, which he had kept, <b>and</b> handed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> he looked intently at <b>it</b>.
<br>   “There are evil things written <b>on</b> this hilt,” he said; “though maybe your eyes cannot see them. Keep <b>it</b>, Aragorn, till we reach <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond! But be wary, <b>and</b> handle <b>it</b> as little as you may! Alas! <b>the</b> wounds <b>of</b> this weapon are beyond my skill <b>to</b> heal. I will do what I can—<b>but</b> all <b>the</b> more do I urge you now <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> without rest.”
<br>   He searched <b>the</b> wound <b>on</b> Frodo's shoulder with his fingers, <b>and</b> his face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt <b>the</b> chill lessen in his side <b>and</b> arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder <b>to</b> his hand, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pain grew easier. The dusk <b>of</b> evening seemed <b>to</b> grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his friends” faces more clearly again, <b>and</b> a measure <b>of</b> new hope <b>and</b> strength returned.
<br>   “You shall ride my horse,” said Glorfindel. “I will shorten <b>the</b> stirrups up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> saddle-skins, <b>and</b> you must sit as tight as you can. But you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him <b>to</b> bear. His pace is light <b>and</b> smooth; <b>and</b> if danger presses too near, he will bear you away with a speed that even <b>the</b> black steeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy cannot rival.”
<br>   “No, he will not!” said Frodo. “I shall not ride him, if I am <b>to</b> be carried off <b>to</b> Rivendell <b>or</b> anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in danger.”
<br>   Glorfindel smiled. “I doubt very much,” he said, “if your friends would be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you <b>and</b> leave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, <b>and</b> that which you bear that brings us all in peril.”
<br>   To that Frodo had <b>no</b> answer, <b>and</b> he was persuaded <b>to</b> mount Glorfindel's white horse. The pony was laden instead with a great part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others” burdens, so that they now marched lighter, <b>and</b> for a time made good speed; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hobbits began <b>to</b> find <b>it</b> hard <b>to</b> keep up with <b>the</b> swift tireless feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf. On he led them, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> darkness, <b>and</b> still <b>on</b> under <b>the</b> deep clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until <b>the</b> grey <b>of</b> dawn did he allow them <b>to</b> halt. Pippin, Merry, <b>and</b> Sam were <b>by</b> that time nearly asleep <b>on</b> their stumbling legs; <b>and</b> even Strider seemed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sag <b>of</b> his shoulders <b>to</b> be weary. Frodo sat upon <b>the</b> horse in a dark dream.
<br>   They cast themselves down in <b>the</b> heather a few yards from <b>the</b> road-side, <b>and</b> fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly <b>to</b> have closed their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself <b>to</b> watch while they slept, awoke them again. The sun had now climbed far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> morning, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> clouds <b>and</b> mists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night were gone.
<br>   “Drink this!” said Glorfindel <b>to</b> them, pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silver-studded flask <b>of</b> leather. It was clear as spring water <b>and</b> had <b>no</b> taste, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> did not feel either cool <b>or</b> warm in <b>the</b> mouth; <b>but</b> strength <b>and</b> vigour seemed <b>to</b> flow <b>into</b> all their limbs as they drank <b>it</b>. Eaten after that draught <b>the</b> stale bread <b>and</b> dried fruit (which was now all that they had left) seemed <b>to</b> satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in <b>the</b> Shire had done.
<br>   They had rested rather less than five hours when they took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road again. Glorfindel still urged them <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> only allowed two brief halts during <b>the</b> day's march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall, <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> a point where <b>the</b> Road bent right <b>and</b> ran down towards <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley, now making straight for <b>the</b> Bruinen. So far there had been <b>no</b> sign <b>or</b> sound <b>of</b> pursuit that <b>the</b> hobbits could see <b>or</b> hear; <b>but</b> often Glorfindel would halt <b>and</b> listen for a moment, if they lagged behind, <b>and</b> a look <b>of</b> anxiety clouded his face. Once <b>or</b> twice he spoke <b>to</b> Strider in <b>the</b> elf-tongue.
<br>   But however anxious their guides might be, <b>it</b> was plain that <b>the</b> hobbits could go <b>no</b> further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with weariness, <b>and</b> unable <b>to</b> think <b>of</b> anything <b>but</b> their feet <b>and</b> legs. Frodo's pain had redoubled, <b>and</b> during <b>the</b> day things about him faded <b>to</b> shadows <b>of</b> ghostly grey. He almost welcomed <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> night, for then <b>the</b> world seemed less pale <b>and</b> empty.
<br>   The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next morning. There were many miles yet <b>to</b> go between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ford, <b>and</b> they hobbled forward at <b>the</b> best pace they could manage.
<br>   “Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach <b>the</b> river,” said Glorfindel; “for my heart warns me that <b>the</b> pursuit is now swift behind us, <b>and</b> other danger may be waiting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ford.”
<br>   The Road was still running steadily downhill, <b>and</b> there was now in places much grass at either side, in which <b>the</b> hobbits walked when they could, <b>to</b> ease their tired feet. In <b>the</b> late afternoon they came <b>to</b> a place where <b>the</b> Road went suddenly under <b>the</b> dark shadow <b>of</b> tall pine-trees, <b>and</b> then plunged <b>into</b> a deep cutting with steep moist walls <b>of</b> red stone. Echoes ran along as they hurried forward; <b>and</b> there seemed <b>to</b> be a sound <b>of</b> many footfalls following their own. All at once, as if through a gate <b>of</b> light, <b>the</b> Road ran out again from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open. There at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, <b>and</b> beyond that <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Rivendell. On <b>the</b> further side was a steep brown bank, threaded <b>by</b> a winding path; <b>and</b> behind that <b>the</b> tall mountains climbed, shoulder above shoulder, <b>and</b> peak beyond peak, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fading sky.
<br>   There was still an echo as <b>of</b> following feet in <b>the</b> cutting behind them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising <b>and</b> pouring through <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pines. One moment Glorfindel turned <b>and</b> listened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.
<br>   “Fly!” he called. “Fly! The enemy is upon us!”
<br>   The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down <b>the</b> slope. Glorfindel <b>and</b> Strider followed as rear-guard. They were only half way across <b>the</b> flat, when suddenly there was a noise <b>of</b> horses galloping. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate in <b>the</b> trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined his horse in, <b>and</b> halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, <b>and</b> then another; then again two more.
<br>   “Ride forward! Ride!” cried Glorfindel <b>to</b> Frodo.
<br>   He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking <b>the</b> horse <b>to</b> a walk, he turned <b>and</b> looked back. The Riders seemed <b>to</b> sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark <b>and</b> solid, while all <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> land about them receded as if <b>into</b> a mist. Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him <b>to</b> wait. Then at once fear <b>and</b> hatred awoke in him. His hand left <b>the</b> bridle <b>and</b> gripped <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his sword, <b>and</b> with a red flash he drew <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Ride <b>on</b>! Ride <b>on</b>!” cried Glorfindel, <b>and</b> then loud <b>and</b> clear he called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horse in <b>the</b> elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!
<br>   At once <b>the</b> white horse sprang away <b>and</b> sped like <b>the</b> wind along <b>the</b> last lap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. At <b>the</b> same moment <b>the</b> black horses leaped down <b>the</b> hill in pursuit, <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had heard filling <b>the</b> woods with horror in <b>the</b> Eastfarthing far away. It was answered; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dismay <b>of</b> Frodo <b>and</b> his friends out from <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> rocks away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo: two galloped madly towards <b>the</b> Ford <b>to</b> cut off his escape. They seemed <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> run like <b>the</b> wind <b>and</b> <b>to</b> grow swiftly larger <b>and</b> darker, as their courses converged with his.
<br>   Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could <b>no</b> longer see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even their great steeds were <b>no</b> match in speed for <b>the</b> white elf-horse <b>of</b> Glorfindel. He looked forward again, <b>and</b> hope faded. There seemed <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> reaching <b>the</b> Ford before he was cut off <b>by</b> <b>the</b> others that had lain in ambush. He could see them clearly now: they appeared <b>to</b> have cast aside their hoods <b>and</b> black cloaks, <b>and</b> they were robed in white <b>and</b> grey. Swords were naked in their pale hands; helms were <b>on</b> their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, <b>and</b> they called <b>to</b> him with fell voices.
<br>   Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He thought <b>no</b> longer <b>of</b> his sword. No cry came from him. He shut his eyes <b>and</b> clung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horse's mane. The wind whistled in his ears, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bells upon <b>the</b> harness rang wild <b>and</b> shrill. A breath <b>of</b> deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash <b>of</b> white fire, <b>the</b> elf-horse speeding as if <b>on</b> wings, passed right before <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foremost Rider.
<br>   Frodo heard <b>the</b> splash <b>of</b> water. It foamed about his feet. He felt <b>the</b> quick heave <b>and</b> surge as <b>the</b> horse left <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> struggled up <b>the</b> stony path. He was climbing <b>the</b> steep bank. He was across <b>the</b> Ford.
<br>   But <b>the</b> pursuers were close behind. At <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank <b>the</b> horse halted <b>and</b> turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at <b>the</b> water's edge below, <b>and</b> Frodo's spirit quailed before <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> their uplifted faces. He knew <b>of</b> nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done; <b>and</b> he felt that <b>it</b> was useless <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> escape over <b>the</b> long uncertain path from <b>the</b> Ford <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> Rivendell, if once <b>the</b> Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently <b>to</b> halt. Hatred again stirred in him, <b>but</b> he had <b>no</b> longer <b>the</b> strength <b>to</b> refuse.
<br>   Suddenly <b>the</b> foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at <b>the</b> water <b>and</b> reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat upright <b>and</b> brandished his sword.
<br>   “Go back!” he cried. “Go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> follow me <b>no</b> more! “His voice sounded thin <b>and</b> shrill in his own ears. The Riders halted, <b>but</b> Frodo had not <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him with a harsh <b>and</b> chilling laughter. “Come back! Come back!” they called. “To Mordor we will take you!”
<br>   “Go back!” he whispered.
<br>   “The Ring! The Ring!” they cried with deadly voices; <b>and</b> immediately their leader urged his horse forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, followed closely <b>by</b> two others.
<br>   “By Elbereth <b>and</b> L?thien <b>the</b> Fair,” said Frodo with a last effort, lifting up his sword, “you shall have neither <b>the</b> Ring nor me!”
<br>   Then <b>the</b> leader, who was now half across <b>the</b> Ford, stood up menacing in his stirrups, <b>and</b> raised up his hand. Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his tongue cleave <b>to</b> his mouth, <b>and</b> his heart labouring. His sword broke <b>and</b> fell out <b>of</b> his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared <b>and</b> snorted. The foremost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black horses had almost set foot upon <b>the</b> shore.
<br>   At that moment there came a roaring <b>and</b> a rushing: a noise <b>of</b> loud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw <b>the</b> river below him rise, <b>and</b> down along its course there came a plumed cavalry <b>of</b> waves. White flames seemed <b>to</b> Frodo <b>to</b> flicker <b>on</b> their crests <b>and</b> he half fancied that he saw amid <b>the</b> water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three Riders that were still in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. Those that were behind drew back in dismay.
<br>   With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he saw, beyond <b>the</b> Riders that hesitated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore, a shining figure <b>of</b> white light; <b>and</b> behind <b>it</b> ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that flared red in <b>the</b> grey mist that was falling over <b>the</b> world.
<br>   The black horses were filled with madness, <b>and</b> leaping forward in terror they bore their riders <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rushing flood. Their piercing cries were drowned in <b>the</b> roaring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river as <b>it</b> carried them away. Then Frodo felt himself falling, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roaring <b>and</b> confusion seemed <b>to</b> rise <b>and</b> engulf him together with his enemies. He heard <b>and</b> saw <b>no</b> more.

<br>Chapter 1
<br>MANY MEETINGS
<br>
<br>   Frodo woke <b>and</b> found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But <b>the</b> ceiling looked strange; <b>it</b> was flat, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> had dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer looking at patches <b>of</b> sunlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> a waterfall.
<br>   “Where am I, <b>and</b> what is <b>the</b> time?” he said aloud <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. “In <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is ten o'clock in <b>the</b> morning.” said a voice. “It is <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> October <b>the</b> twenty-fourth, if you want <b>to</b> know.”
<br>   “Gandalf!” cried Frodo, sitting up. There was <b>the</b> old wizard, sitting in a chair <b>by</b> <b>the</b> open window.
<br>   “Yes,” he said, “I am here. And you are lucky <b>to</b> be here, too, after all <b>the</b> absurd things you have done since you left home.” Frodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable <b>and</b> peaceful <b>to</b> argue, <b>and</b> in any case he did not think he would get <b>the</b> better <b>of</b> an argument. He was fully awake now, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> his journey was returning: <b>the</b> disastrous “short cut” through <b>the</b> Old Forest <b>the</b> “accident” at The Prancing Pony; <b>and</b> his madness in putting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring in <b>the</b> dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking <b>of</b> all these things <b>and</b> trying in vain <b>to</b> bring his memory down <b>to</b> his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> soft puffs <b>of</b> Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window.
<br>   “Where's Sam?” Frodo asked at length. “And are <b>the</b> others all right?”
<br>   “Yes, they are all safe <b>and</b> sound,” answered Gandalf. “Sam was here until I sent him off <b>to</b> get some rest, about half an hour ago.”
<br>   “What happened at <b>the</b> Ford?” said Frodo. “It all seemed so dim somehow; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> still does.”
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> would. You were beginning <b>to</b> fade,” answered Gandalf. “The wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours <b>and</b> you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you showed in <b>the</b> Barrow. That was touch <b>and</b> go: perhaps <b>the</b> most dangerous moment <b>of</b> all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.”
<br>   “You seem <b>to</b> know a great deal already,” said Frodo. “I have not spoken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others about <b>the</b> Barrow. At first <b>it</b> was too horrible; <b>and</b> afterwards there were other things <b>to</b> think about. How do you know about <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,” said Gandalf gently, “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> has not been hard for me <b>to</b> read your mind <b>and</b> memory. Do not worry! Though I said “absurd” just now, I did not mean <b>it</b>. I think well <b>of</b> you—<b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others. It is <b>no</b> small feat <b>to</b> have come so far, <b>and</b> through such dangers, still bearing <b>the</b> Ring.”
<br>   “We should never have done <b>it</b> without Strider,” said Frodo. “But we needed you. I did not know what <b>to</b> do without you.”
<br>   “I was delayed,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> that nearly proved our ruin. And yet I am not sure; <b>it</b> may have been better so.”
<br>   “I wish you would tell me what happened!”
<br>   “All in good time! You are not supposed <b>to</b> talk <b>or</b> worry about anything today, <b>by</b> Elrond's orders.”
<br>   “But talking would stop me thinking <b>and</b> wondering, which are quite as tiring,” said Frodo. “I am wide awake now, <b>and</b> I remember so many things that want explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought <b>to</b> tell me that at least.”
<br>   “You will soon hear all you wish <b>to</b> know,” said Gandalf. “We shall have a Council, as soon as you are well enough. At <b>the</b> moment I will only say that I was held captive.”
<br>   “You?” cried Frodo.
<br>   “Yes, I, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey,” said <b>the</b> wizard solemnly. “There are many powers in <b>the</b> world, for good <b>or</b> for evil. Some are greater than I am. Against some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming. The Morgul-lord <b>and</b> his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!”
<br>   “Then you knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders already-before I met them?”
<br>   “Yes, I knew <b>of</b> them. Indeed I spoke <b>of</b> them once <b>to</b> you; for <b>the</b> Black Riders are <b>the</b> Ringwraiths, <b>the</b> Nine Servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings. But I did not know that they had arisen again <b>or</b> I should have fled with you at once. I heard news <b>of</b> them only after I left you in June; <b>but</b> that story must wait. For <b>the</b> moment we have been saved from disaster, <b>by</b> Aragorn.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Frodo, “<b>it</b> was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid <b>of</b> him at first. Sam never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we met Glorfindel.”
<br>   Gandalf smiled. “I have heard all about Sam,” he said. “He has <b>no</b> more doubts now.”
<br>   “I am glad,” said Frodo. “For I have become very fond <b>of</b> Strider. Well, fond is not <b>the</b> right word. I mean he is dear <b>to</b> me; though he is strange, <b>and</b> grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often <b>of</b> you. I didn't know that any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just big, <b>and</b> rather stupid: kind <b>and</b> stupid like Butterbur; <b>or</b> stupid <b>and</b> wicked like Bill Ferny. But then we don't know much about Men in <b>the</b> Shire, except perhaps <b>the</b> Breelanders.”
<br>   “You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,” said Gandalf. “He is wise enough <b>on</b> his own ground. He thinks less than he talks, <b>and</b> slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as they say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn. The race <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings from over <b>the</b> Sea is nearly at an end. It may be that this War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring will be their last adventure.”
<br>   “Do you really mean that Strider is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Kings?” said Frodo in wonder. “I thought they had all vanished long ago. I thought he was only a Ranger.”
<br>   “Only a Ranger!” cried Gandalf. “My dear Frodo, that is just what <b>the</b> Rangers are: <b>the</b> last remnant in <b>the</b> North <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great people, <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. They have helped me before; <b>and</b> I shall need their help in <b>the</b> days <b>to</b> come; for we have reached Rivendell, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Ring is not yet at rest.”
<br>   “I suppose not,” said Frodo. “But so far my only thought has been <b>to</b> get here; <b>and</b> I hope I shan't have <b>to</b> go any further. It is very pleasant just <b>to</b> rest. I have had a month <b>of</b> exile <b>and</b> adventure, <b>and</b> I find that has been as much as I want.”
<br>   He fell silent <b>and</b> shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. “I have been reckoning,” he said, “<b>and</b> I can't bring <b>the</b> total up <b>to</b> October <b>the</b> twenty-fourth. It ought <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> twenty-first. We must have reached <b>the</b> Ford <b>by</b> <b>the</b> twentieth.”
<br>   “You have talked <b>and</b> reckoned more than is good for you,” said Gandalf. “How do <b>the</b> side <b>and</b> shoulder feel now?”
<br>   “I don't know.” Frodo answered. “They don't feel at all: which is an improvement, <b>but</b>'–he made an effort–'I can move my arm again a little. Yes, <b>it</b> is coming back <b>to</b> life. It is not cold,” he added, touching his left hand with his right.
<br>   “Good!” said Gandalf. “It is mending fast. You will soon be sound again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought in.”
<br>   “Days?” said Frodo.
<br>   “Well, four nights <b>and</b> three days, <b>to</b> be exact. The Elves brought you from this where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, <b>and</b> Sam has hardly left your side, day <b>or</b> night, except <b>to</b> run messages. Elrond is a master <b>of</b> healing, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> weapons <b>of</b> our Enemy are deadly. To tell you <b>the</b> truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blade still in <b>the</b> closed wound. But <b>it</b> could not be found until last night. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was deeply buried. <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was working inwards.”
<br>   Frodo shuddered, remembering <b>the</b> cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Strider's hands. “Don't be alarmed!” said Gandalf. “It is gone now. It has been melted. And <b>it</b> seems that Hobbits fade very reluctantly. I have known strong warriors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People who would quickly have been overcome <b>by</b> that splinter, which you bore for seventeen days.”
<br>   “What would they have done <b>to</b> me?” asked Frodo. “What were <b>the</b> Riders trying <b>to</b> do?”
<br>   “They tried <b>to</b> pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in <b>the</b> wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only weaker <b>and</b> under their command. You would have became a wraith under <b>the</b> dominion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord; <b>and</b> he would have tormented you for trying <b>to</b> keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> seeing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his hand.”
<br>   “Thank goodness I did not realize <b>the</b> horrible danger!” said Frodo faintly. I was mortally afraid, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> if I had known more, I should not have dared even <b>to</b> move. It is a marvel that I escaped!”
<br>   “Yes, fortune <b>or</b> fate have helped you,” said Gandalf, “not <b>to</b> mention courage. For your heart was not touched, <b>and</b> only your shoulder was pierced; <b>and</b> that was because you resisted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last. But <b>it</b> was a terribly narrow shave, so <b>to</b> speak. You were in gravest peril while you wore <b>the</b> Ring, for then you were half in <b>the</b> wraith-world yourself, <b>and</b> they might have seized you. You could see them, <b>and</b> they could see you.”
<br>   “I know,” said Frodo. “They were terrible <b>to</b> behold! But why could we all see their horses?”
<br>   “Because they are real horses; just as <b>the</b> black robes are real robes that they wear <b>to</b> give shape <b>to</b> their nothingness when they have dealings with <b>the</b> living.”
<br>   “Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals are terrified when they draw near, even <b>the</b> elf-horse <b>of</b> Glorfindel. The dogs howl <b>and</b> <b>the</b> geese scream at them.”
<br>   “Because these horses are born <b>and</b> bred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord in Mordor. Not all his servants <b>and</b> chattels are wraiths! There are orcs <b>and</b> trolls, there are wargs <b>and</b> werewolves; <b>and</b> there have been <b>and</b> still are many Men, warriors <b>and</b> kings, that walk alive under <b>the</b> Sun, <b>and</b> yet are under his sway. And their number is growing daily.”
<br>   “What about Rivendell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves? Is Rivendell safe?”
<br>   “Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear <b>the</b> Dark Lord, <b>and</b> they may fly before him, <b>but</b> never again will they listen <b>to</b> him <b>or</b> serve him. And here in Rivendell there live still some <b>of</b> his chief foes: <b>the</b> Elven-wise, lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eldar from beyond <b>the</b> furthest seas. They do not fear <b>the</b> Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in <b>the</b> Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds, <b>and</b> against both <b>the</b> Seen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Unseen they have great power.”
<br>   “I thought that I saw a white figure that shone <b>and</b> did not grow dim like <b>the</b> others. Was that Glorfindel then?”
<br>   “Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon <b>the</b> other side: one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mighty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Firstborn. He is an Elf-lord <b>of</b> a house <b>of</b> princes. Indeed there is a power in Rivendell <b>to</b> withstand <b>the</b> might <b>of</b> Mordor, for a while: <b>and</b> elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, <b>of</b> another kind in <b>the</b> Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if things go <b>on</b> as they are going. The Dark Lord is putting forth all his strength.
<br>   “Still,” he said, standing suddenly up <b>and</b> sticking out his chin. while his beard went stiff <b>and</b> straight like bristling wire, “we must keep up our courage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk you <b>to</b> death. You are in Rivendell, <b>and</b> you need not worry about anything for <b>the</b> present.”
<br>   “I haven't any courage <b>to</b> keep up,” said Frodo, “<b>but</b> I am not worried at <b>the</b> moment. Just give me news <b>of</b> my friends, <b>and</b> tell me <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair at <b>the</b> Ford, as I keep <b>on</b> asking, <b>and</b> I shall be content for <b>the</b> present. After that I shall have another sleep, I think; <b>but</b> I shan't be able <b>to</b> close my eyes until you have finished <b>the</b> story for me.”
<br>   Gandalf moved his chair <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedside, <b>and</b> took a good look at Frodo. The colour had come back <b>to</b> his face, <b>and</b> his eyes were clear, <b>and</b> fully awake <b>and</b> aware. He was smiling, <b>and</b> there seemed <b>to</b> be little wrong with him. But <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as <b>it</b> were <b>of</b> transparency, about him, <b>and</b> especially about <b>the</b> left hand that lay outside upon <b>the</b> coverlet.
<br>   “Still that must be expected,” said Gandalf <b>to</b> himself. “He is not half through yet, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> what he will come in <b>the</b> end not even Elrond can foretell. Not <b>to</b> evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes <b>to</b> see that can.”
<br>   “You look splendid,” he said aloud. “I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, <b>and</b> then you must sleep again. This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders made straight for you, as soon as you fled. They did not need <b>the</b> guidance <b>of</b> their horses any longer: you had become visible <b>to</b> them, being already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> threshold <b>of</b> their world. And also <b>the</b> Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off <b>the</b> road, <b>or</b> they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save you, if <b>the</b> white horse could not. The Riders were too swift <b>to</b> overtake, <b>and</b> too many <b>to</b> oppose. On foot even Glorfindel <b>and</b> Aragorn together could not with stand all <b>the</b> Nine at once.
<br>   “When <b>the</b> Ringwraiths swept <b>by</b>, your friends ran up behind. Close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford there is a small hollow beside <b>the</b> road masked <b>by</b> a few stunted trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down, if <b>the</b> Riders tried <b>to</b> cross, <b>and</b> then he would have <b>to</b> deal with any that were left <b>on</b> his side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. The moment <b>the</b> flood appeared, he rushed out, followed <b>by</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> <b>the</b>. others with flaming brands. Caught between fire <b>and</b> water, <b>and</b> seeing an Elf-lord revealed in his wrath, they were dismayed, <b>and</b> their horses were stricken with madness. Three were carried away <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first assault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flood; <b>the</b> others were now hurled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water <b>by</b> their horses <b>and</b> overwhelmed.”
<br>   “And is that <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf. “Their horses must have perished, <b>and</b> without them they are crippled. But <b>the</b> Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed. However, there is nothing more <b>to</b> fear from them at present. Your friends crossed after <b>the</b> flood had passed; <b>and</b> they found you lying <b>on</b> your face at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank, with a broken sword under you. The horse was standing guard beside you. You were pale <b>and</b> cold, <b>and</b> they feared that you were dead, <b>or</b> worse. Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards Rivendell.”
<br>   “Who made <b>the</b> flood?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “Elrond commanded <b>it</b>,” answered Gandalf. “The river <b>of</b> this valley is under his power, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will rise in anger when he has great need <b>to</b> bar <b>the</b> Ford. As soon as <b>the</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ringwraiths rode <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water <b>the</b> flood was released. If I may say so, I added a few touches <b>of</b> my own: you may not have noticed, <b>but</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waves took <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> great white horses with shining white riders; <b>and</b> there were many rolling <b>and</b> grinding boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flood would get out <b>of</b> hand <b>and</b> wash you all away. There is great vigour in <b>the</b> waters that come down from <b>the</b> snows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains.”
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> all comes back <b>to</b> me now,” said Frodo: “<b>the</b> tremendous roaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends <b>and</b> enemies <b>and</b> all. But now we are safe!”
<br>   Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, <b>but</b> he had shut his eyes. “Yes, you are all safe for <b>the</b> present. Soon there will be feasting <b>and</b> merrymaking <b>to</b> celebrate <b>the</b> victory at <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen, <b>and</b> you will all be there in places <b>of</b> honour.”
<br>   “Splendid!” said Frodo. “It is wonderful that Elrond, <b>and</b> Glorfindel <b>and</b> such great lords, not <b>to</b> mention Strider, should take so much trouble <b>and</b> show me so much kindness.”
<br>   “Well, there are many reasons why they should,” said Gandalf, smiling. “I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are <b>the</b> Ring-bearer. And you are <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>the</b> Ring-finder.”
<br>   “Dear Bilbo!” said Frodo sleepily. “I wonder where he is. I wish he was here <b>and</b> could hear all about <b>it</b>. It would have made him laugh, The cow jumped over <b>the</b> Moon! And <b>the</b> poor old troll!” With that he fell fast asleep.
<br>   Frodo was now safe in <b>the</b> Last Homely House east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea. That house was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, “a perfect house, whether you like food <b>or</b> sleep, <b>or</b> story-telling <b>or</b> singing, <b>or</b> just sitting <b>and</b> thinking best, <b>or</b> a pleasant mixture <b>of</b> them all”. Merely <b>to</b> be there was a cure for weariness, fear, <b>and</b> sadness.
<br>   As <b>the</b> evening drew <b>on</b>, Frodo woke up again, <b>and</b> he found that he <b>no</b> longer felt in need <b>of</b> rest <b>or</b> sleep, <b>but</b> had a mind for food <b>and</b> drink, <b>and</b> probably for singing <b>and</b> story-telling afterwards. He got out <b>of</b> bed <b>and</b> discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as <b>it</b> ever had been. He found laid ready clean garments <b>of</b> green cloth that fitted him excellently. Looking in a mirror he was startled <b>to</b> see a much thinner reflection <b>of</b> himself than he remembered: <b>it</b> looked remarkably like <b>the</b> young nephew <b>of</b> Bilbo who used <b>to</b> go tramping with his uncle in <b>the</b> Shire; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.
<br>   “Yes, you have seen a thing <b>or</b> two since you last peeped out <b>of</b> a looking-glass,” he said <b>to</b> his reflection. “But now for a merry meeting!”
<br>   He stretched out his arms <b>and</b> whistled a tune.
<br>   At that moment there was a knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> Sam came in. He ran <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> took his left hand, awkwardly <b>and</b> shyly. He stroked <b>it</b> gently <b>and</b> then he blushed <b>and</b> turned hastily away.
<br>   “Hullo, Sam!” said Frodo.
<br>   “It's warm!” said Sam. “Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so cold through <b>the</b> long nights. But glory <b>and</b> trumpets!” he cried, turning round again with shining eyes <b>and</b> dancing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. “It's fine <b>to</b> see you up <b>and</b> yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me <b>to</b> come <b>and</b> see if you were ready <b>to</b> come down, <b>and</b> I thought he was joking.”
<br>   “I am ready,” said Frodo. “Let's go <b>and</b> look for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party!”
<br>   “I can take you <b>to</b> them, sir,” said Sam. “It's a big house this, <b>and</b> very peculiar. Always a bit more <b>to</b> discover, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> knowing what you'll find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, <b>and</b> Elves there! Some like kings, terrible <b>and</b> splendid; <b>and</b> some as merry as children. And <b>the</b> music <b>and</b> <b>the</b> singing-not that I have had <b>the</b> time <b>or</b> <b>the</b> heart for much listening since we got here. But I'm getting <b>to</b> know some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place.”
<br>   “I know what you have been doing, Sam,” said Frodo, taking his arm. “But you shall be merry tonight, <b>and</b> listen <b>to</b> your heart's content. Come <b>on</b>, guide me round <b>the</b> corners!”
<br>   Sam led him along several passages <b>and</b> down many steps <b>and</b> out <b>into</b> a high garden above <b>the</b> steep bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. He found his friends sitting in a porch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house looking east. Shadows had fallen in <b>the</b> valley below, <b>but</b> there was still a light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains far above. The air was warm. The sound <b>of</b> running <b>and</b> falling water was loud, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evening was filled with a faint scent <b>of</b> trees <b>and</b> flowers, as if summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.
<br>   “Hurray!” cried Pippin, springing up. “Here is our noble cousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring!”
<br>   “Hush!” said Gandalf from <b>the</b> shadows at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porch. “Evil things do not come <b>into</b> this valley; <b>but</b> all <b>the</b> same we should not name them. The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring is not Frodo, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower <b>of</b> Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over <b>the</b> world! We are sitting in a fortress. Outside <b>it</b> is getting dark.”
<br>   “Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,” said Pippin. “He thinks I need keeping in order. But <b>it</b> seems impossible, somehow, <b>to</b> feel gloomy <b>or</b> depressed in this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew <b>the</b> right song for <b>the</b> occasion.”
<br>   “I feel like singing myself,” laughed Frodo. “Though at <b>the</b> moment I feel more like eating <b>and</b> drinking!”
<br>   “That will soon be cured,” said Pippin. “You have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.”
<br>   “More than meal! A feast!” said Merry. “As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, <b>the</b> preparations began.” He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ringing <b>of</b> many bells.
<br>   The hall <b>of</b> Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for <b>the</b> most part, though there were a few guests <b>of</b> other sorts. Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long table upon <b>the</b> dais; <b>and</b> next <b>to</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one side sat Glorfindel, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side sat Gandalf.
<br>   Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, <b>of</b> whom so many tales spoke; <b>and</b> as they sat upon his right hand <b>and</b> his left, Glorfindel, <b>and</b> even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords <b>of</b> dignity <b>and</b> power. Gandalf was shorter in stature than <b>the</b> other two; <b>but</b> his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, <b>and</b> his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king <b>of</b> ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly <b>into</b> fire.
<br>   Glorfindel was tall <b>and</b> straight; his hair was <b>of</b> shining gold, his face fair <b>and</b> young <b>and</b> fearless <b>and</b> full <b>of</b> joy; his eyes were bright <b>and</b> keen, <b>and</b> his voice like music; <b>on</b> his brow sat wisdom, <b>and</b> in his hand was strength.
<br>   The face <b>of</b> Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in <b>it</b> was written <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> many things both glad <b>and</b> sorrowful. His hair was dark as <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> twilight, <b>and</b> upon <b>it</b> was set a circlet <b>of</b> silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, <b>and</b> in them was a light like <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, <b>and</b> yet hale as a tried warrior in <b>the</b> fulness <b>of</b> his strength. He was <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>and</b> mighty among both Elves <b>and</b> Men.
<br>   In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, against <b>the</b> woven cloths upon <b>the</b> wall, there was a chair under a canopy, <b>and</b> there sat a lady fair <b>to</b> look upon, <b>and</b> so like was she in form <b>of</b> womanhood <b>to</b> Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one <b>of</b> his close kindred. Young she was <b>and</b> yet not so. The braids <b>of</b> her dark hair were touched <b>by</b> <b>no</b> frost, her white arms <b>and</b> clear face were flawless <b>and</b> smooth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, <b>and</b> thought <b>and</b> knowledge were in her glance, as <b>of</b> one who has known many things that <b>the</b> years bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap <b>of</b> silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; <b>but</b> her soft grey raiment had <b>no</b> ornament save a girdle <b>of</b> leaves wrought in silver.
<br>   So <b>it</b> was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter <b>of</b> Elrond, in whom <b>it</b> was said that <b>the</b> likeness <b>of</b> L?thien had come <b>on</b> earth again; <b>and</b> she was called Und?miel, for she was <b>the</b> Evenstar <b>of</b> her people. Long she had been in <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> her mother's kin, in L?rien beyond <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> was <b>but</b> lately returned <b>to</b> Rivendell <b>to</b> her father's house. But her brothers, Elladan <b>and</b> Elrohir, were out upon errantry: for they rode often far afield with <b>the</b> Rangers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, forgetting never their mother's torment in <b>the</b> dens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orcs.
<br>   Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind; <b>and</b> he was both surprised <b>and</b> abashed <b>to</b> find that he had a seat at Elrond's table among all these folk so high <b>and</b> fair. Though he had a suitable chair, <b>and</b> was raised upon several cushions, he felt very small, <b>and</b> rather out <b>of</b> place; <b>but</b> that feeling quickly passed. The feast was merry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> food all that his hunger could desire. It was some time before he looked about him again <b>or</b> even turned <b>to</b> his neighbours.
<br>   He looked first for his friends. Sam had begged <b>to</b> be allowed <b>to</b> wait <b>on</b> his master, <b>but</b> had been told that for this time he was a guest <b>of</b> honour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin <b>and</b> Merry at <b>the</b> upper end <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-tables close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dais. He could see <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> Strider.
<br>   Next <b>to</b> Frodo <b>on</b> his right sat a dwarf <b>of</b> important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, very long <b>and</b> forked, was white, nearly as white as <b>the</b> snow-white cloth <b>of</b> his garments. He wore a silver belt, <b>and</b> round his neck hung a chain <b>of</b> silver <b>and</b> diamonds. Frodo stopped eating <b>to</b> look at him.
<br>   “Welcome <b>and</b> well met!” said <b>the</b> dwarf, turning towards him. Then he actually rose from his seat <b>and</b> bowed. “Gl?in at your service,” he said, <b>and</b> bowed still lower.
<br>   “Frodo Baggins at your service <b>and</b> your family's,” said Frodo correctly, rising in surprise <b>and</b> scattering his cushions. “Am I right in guessing that you are <b>the</b> Gl?in, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve companions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great Thorin Oakenshield?”
<br>   “Quite right,” answered <b>the</b> dwarf, gathering up <b>the</b> cushions <b>and</b> courteously assisting Frodo back <b>into</b> his seat. “And I do not ask, for I have already been told that you are <b>the</b> kinsman <b>and</b> adopted heir <b>of</b> our friend Bilbo <b>the</b> renowned. Allow me <b>to</b> congratulate you <b>on</b> your recovery.”
<br>   “Thank you very much,” said Frodo.
<br>   “You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,” said Gl?in. “I wonder greatly what brings four hobbits <b>on</b> so long a journey. Nothing like <b>it</b> has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since Elrond <b>and</b> Gandalf do not seem disposed <b>to</b> talk <b>of</b> this?”
<br>   “I think we will not speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, at least not yet,” said Frodo politely.
<br>   He guessed that even in Elrond's house <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring was not one for casual talk; <b>and</b> in any case he wished <b>to</b> forget his troubles for a time. “But I am equally curious,” he added, “<b>to</b> learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain.”
<br>   Gl?in looked at him. “If you have not heard, I think we will not speak yet <b>of</b> that either. Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe, <b>and</b> then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that may be told.”
<br>   Throughout <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meal they talked together, <b>but</b> Frodo listened more than he spoke; for <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, apart from <b>the</b> Ring, seemed small <b>and</b> far-away <b>and</b> unimportant, while Gl?in had much <b>to</b> tell <b>of</b> events in <b>the</b> northern regions <b>of</b> Wilderland. Frodo learned that Grimbeorn <b>the</b> Old, son <b>of</b> Beorn, was now <b>the</b> lord <b>of</b> many sturdy men, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their land between <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared <b>to</b> go.
<br>   “lndeed,” said Gl?in, “if <b>it</b> were not for <b>the</b> Beornings, <b>the</b> passage from Dale <b>to</b> Rivendell would long ago have become impossible. They are valiant men <b>and</b> keep open <b>the</b> High Pass <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Carrock. But their tolls are high,” he added with a shake <b>of</b> his head; “<b>and</b> like Beorn <b>of</b> old they are not over fond <b>of</b> dwarves. Still, they are trusty, <b>and</b> that is much in these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly <b>to</b> us as <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Dale. They are good folk, <b>the</b> Bardings. The grandson <b>of</b> Bard <b>the</b> Bowman rules them, Brand son <b>of</b> Bain son <b>of</b> Bard. He is a strong king, <b>and</b> his realm now reaches far south <b>and</b> east <b>of</b> Esgaroth.”
<br>   “And what <b>of</b> your own people?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “There is much <b>to</b> tell, good <b>and</b> bad,” said Gl?in; “yet <b>it</b> is mostly good: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> these times. If you really wish <b>to</b> hear <b>of</b> us, I will tell you tidings gladly. But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves” tongues run <b>on</b> when speaking <b>of</b> their handiwork, they say.”
<br>   And with that Gl?in embarked <b>on</b> a long account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarf-kingdom. He was delighted <b>to</b> have found so polite a listener; for Frodo showed <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> weariness <b>and</b> made <b>no</b> attempt <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject, though actually he soon got rather lost among <b>the</b> strange names <b>of</b> people <b>and</b> places that he had never heard <b>of</b> before. He was interested, however, <b>to</b> hear that D?in was still King under <b>the</b> Mountain, <b>and</b> was now old (having passed his two hundred <b>and</b> fiftieth year), venerable, <b>and</b> fabulously rich. Of <b>the</b> ten companions who had survived <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies seven were still with him: Dwalin, Gl?in, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, <b>and</b> Bombur. Bombur was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch <b>to</b> his chair at table, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> took six young dwarves <b>to</b> lift him.
<br>   “And what has become <b>of</b> Balin <b>and</b> Ori <b>and</b> ?in?” asked Frodo.
<br>   A shadow passed over Gl?in's face. “We do not know,” he answered. “It is largely <b>on</b> account <b>of</b> Balin that I have come <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> those that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak <b>of</b> merrier things!”
<br>   Gl?in began then <b>to</b> talk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> his people, telling Frodo about their great labours in Dale <b>and</b> under <b>the</b> Mountain. “We have done well,” he said. “But in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers, many <b>of</b> whose. secrets are lost. We make good armour <b>and</b> keen swords, <b>but</b> we cannot again make mail <b>or</b> blade <b>to</b> match those that were made before <b>the</b> dragon came. Only in mining <b>and</b> building have we surpassed <b>the</b> old days. You should see <b>the</b> waterways <b>of</b> Dale, Frodo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fountains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pools! You should see <b>the</b> stone-paved roads <b>of</b> many colours! And <b>the</b> halls <b>and</b> cavernous streets under <b>the</b> earth with arches carved like trees; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terraces <b>and</b> towers upon <b>the</b> Mountain's sides! Then you would see that we have not been idle.”
<br>   “I will come <b>and</b> see them, if ever I can,” said Frodo. “How surprised Bilbo would have been <b>to</b> see all <b>the</b> changes in <b>the</b> Desolation <b>of</b> Smaug!”
<br>   Gl?in looked at Frodo <b>and</b> smiled. “You were very fond <b>of</b> Bilbo were you not?” he asked.
<br>   “Yes,” answered Frodo. “I would rather see him than all <b>the</b> towers <b>and</b> palaces in <b>the</b> world.”
<br>   At length <b>the</b> feast came <b>to</b> an end. Elrond <b>and</b> Arwen rose <b>and</b> went down <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> company followed them in due order. The doors were thrown open, <b>and</b> they went across a wide passage <b>and</b> through other doors, <b>and</b> came <b>into</b> a further hall. In <b>it</b> were <b>no</b> tables, <b>but</b> a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between <b>the</b> carven pillars upon either side.
<br>   Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. “This is <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fire” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Here you will hear many songs <b>and</b> tales-if you can keep awake. But except <b>on</b> high days <b>it</b> usually stands empty <b>and</b> quiet, <b>and</b> people come here who wish for peace, <b>and</b> thought. There is always a fire here, all <b>the</b> year round, <b>but</b> there is little other light.”
<br>   As Elrond entered <b>and</b> went towards <b>the</b> seat prepared for him, elvish minstrels began <b>to</b> make sweet music. Slowly <b>the</b> hall filled, <b>and</b> Frodo looked with delight upon <b>the</b> many fair faces that were gathered together; <b>the</b> golden firelight played upon them <b>and</b> shimmered in their hair. Suddenly he noticed, not far from <b>the</b> further end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, a small dark figure seated <b>on</b> a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground was a drinking-cup <b>and</b> some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), <b>and</b> had been unable <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feast. His head seemed sunk in sleep <b>on</b> his breast, <b>and</b> a fold <b>of</b> his dark cloak was drawn over his face.
<br>   Elrond went forward <b>and</b> stood beside <b>the</b> silent figure. “Awake little master. he said, with a smile. Then, turning <b>to</b> Frodo, he beckoned <b>to</b> him. “Now at last <b>the</b> hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,” he said. “Here is a friend that you have long missed.”
<br>   The dark figure raised its head <b>and</b> uncovered its face.
<br>   “Bilbo!” cried Frodo with sudden recognition, <b>and</b> he sprang forward.
<br>   “Hullo, Frodo my lad!” said Bilbo. “So you have got here at last. I hoped you would manage <b>it</b>. Well, well! So all this feasting is in your honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?”
<br>   “Why weren't you there?” cried Frodo. “And why haven't I been allowed <b>to</b> see you before?”
<br>   “Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal <b>of</b> you. I have sat <b>by</b> your side with Sam each day. But as for <b>the</b> feast` I don't go in for such things much now. And I had something else <b>to</b> do.”
<br>   “What were you doing?”
<br>   “Why, sitting <b>and</b> thinking. I do a lot <b>of</b> that nowadays, <b>and</b> this is <b>the</b> best place <b>to</b> do <b>it</b> in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!” he said, cocking an eye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> sleepiness that Frodo could see. “Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want <b>to</b> know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, <b>and</b> you have disturbed me-in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> making up a song. I was stuck over a line <b>or</b> two, <b>and</b> was thinking about them; <b>but</b> now I don't suppose I shall ever get them right. There will be such a deal <b>of</b> singing that <b>the</b> ideas will be driven clean out <b>of</b> my head. I shall have <b>to</b> get my friend <b>the</b> D?nadan <b>to</b> help me. Where is he?”
<br>   Elrond laughed. “He shall be found,” he said. “Then you two shall go <b>into</b> a corner <b>and</b> finish your task, <b>and</b> we will hear <b>it</b> <b>and</b> judge <b>it</b> before we end our merrymaking.” Messengers were sent <b>to</b> find Bilbo's friend, though none knew where he was, <b>or</b> why he had not been present at <b>the</b> feast.
<br>   In <b>the</b> meanwhile Frodo <b>and</b> Bilbo sat side <b>by</b> side, <b>and</b> Sam came quickly <b>and</b> placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mirth <b>and</b> music in <b>the</b> hall about them. Bilbo had not much <b>to</b> say <b>of</b> himself. When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along <b>the</b> Road <b>or</b> in <b>the</b> country <b>on</b> either side; <b>but</b> somehow he had steered all <b>the</b> time towards Rivendell. “I got here without much adventure,” he said, “<b>and</b> after a rest I went <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> dwarves <b>to</b> Dale: my last journey. I shan't travel again. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back here, <b>and</b> here I have been. I have done this <b>and</b> that. I have written some more <b>of</b> my book. And, <b>of</b> course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just <b>to</b> please me, I think; for, <b>of</b> course, they aren't really good enough for Rivendell. And I listen <b>and</b> I think. Time doesn't seem <b>to</b> pass here: <b>it</b> just is. A remarkable place altogether.
<br>   “I hear all kinds <b>of</b> news, from over <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>but</b> hardly anything from <b>the</b> Shire. I heard about <b>the</b> Ring, <b>of</b> course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal, he has become closer than ever these last few years. The D?nadan has told me more. Fancy that ring <b>of</b> mine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner. I could have brought <b>the</b> thing here myself long ago without so much trouble. I have thought several times <b>of</b> going back <b>to</b> Hobbiton for <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> I am getting old, <b>and</b> they would not let me: Gandalf <b>and</b> Elrond, I mean. They seemed <b>to</b> think that <b>the</b> Enemy was looking high <b>and</b> low for me, <b>and</b> would make mincemeat <b>of</b> me, if he caught me tottering about in <b>the</b> Wild.
<br>   “And Gandalf said: “The Ring has passed <b>on</b>, Bilbo. It would do <b>no</b> good <b>to</b> you <b>or</b> <b>to</b> others, if you tried <b>to</b> meddle with <b>it</b> again.” Odd sort <b>of</b> remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let things be. I am frightfully glad <b>to</b> see you safe <b>and</b> sound.” He paused <b>and</b> looked at Frodo doubtfully.
<br>   “Have you got <b>it</b> here?” he asked in a whisper. “I can't help feeling curious, you know, after all I've heard. I should very much like just <b>to</b> peep at <b>it</b> again.”
<br>   “Yes, I've got <b>it</b>,” answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. “It looks just <b>the</b> same as ever <b>it</b> did.”
<br>   “Well, I should just like <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> for a moment,” said Bilbo.
<br>   When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept <b>the</b> Ring had been hung about his neck <b>on</b> a new chain, light <b>but</b> strong. Slowly he drew <b>it</b> out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back <b>the</b> Ring. To his distress <b>and</b> amazement he found that he was <b>no</b> longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed <b>to</b> have fallen between them, <b>and</b> through <b>it</b> he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face <b>and</b> bony groping hands. He felt a desire <b>to</b> strike him.
<br>   The music <b>and</b> singing round them seemed <b>to</b> falter <b>and</b> a silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face <b>and</b> passed his hand across his eyes. “I understand now,” he said. “Put <b>it</b> away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in for this burden: sorry about everything. Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has <b>to</b> carry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> story. Well, <b>it</b> can't be helped. I wonder if <b>it</b>'s any good trying <b>to</b> finish my book? But don't let's worry about <b>it</b> now-let's have some real News! Tell me all about <b>the</b> Shire!”
<br>   Frodo hid <b>the</b> Ring away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow passed leaving hardly a shred <b>of</b> memory. The light <b>and</b> music <b>of</b> Rivendell was about him again. Bilbo smiled <b>and</b> laughed happily. Every item <b>of</b> news from <b>the</b> Shire that Frodo could tell-aided <b>and</b> corrected now <b>and</b> again <b>by</b> Sam-was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest interest <b>to</b> him, from <b>the</b> felling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least tree <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest child in Hobbiton. They were so deep in <b>the</b> doings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Four Farthings that they did not notice <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> a man clad in dark green cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.
<br>   Suddenly Bilbo looked up. “Ah, there you are at last, D?nadan!” he cried.
<br>   “Strider!” said Frodo. “You seem <b>to</b> have a lot <b>of</b> names.”
<br>   “Well, Strider is one that I haven't heard before, anyway,” said Bilbo. “What do you call him that for?”
<br>   “They call me that in Bree,” said Strider laughing, “<b>and</b> that is how I was introduced <b>to</b> him.”
<br>   “And why do you call him D?nadan?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “The D?nadan,” said Bilbo. “He is often called that here. But I thought you knew enough Elvish at least <b>to</b> know d?n-udan: Man <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, N?menorean. But this is not <b>the</b> time for lessons!” He turned <b>to</b> Strider.
<br>   “Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at <b>the</b> feast? The Lady Arwen was there.”
<br>   Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. “I know,” he said. “But often I must put mirth aside. Elladan <b>and</b> Elrohir have returned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wild unlooked-for, <b>and</b> they had tidings that I wished <b>to</b> hear at once.”
<br>   “Well, my dear fellow,” said Bilbo, “now you've heard <b>the</b> news, can't you spare me a moment? I want your help in something urgent. Elrond says this song <b>of</b> mine is <b>to</b> be finished before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, <b>and</b> I am stuck. Let's go off <b>into</b> a corner <b>and</b> polish <b>it</b> up!”
<br>   Strider smiled. “Come then!” he said. “Let me hear <b>it</b>!”
<br>   Frodo was left <b>to</b> himself for a while. for Sam had fallen asleep. He was alone <b>and</b> felt rather forlorn` although all about him <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent upon <b>the</b> music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voices <b>and</b> <b>the</b> instruments. <b>and</b> they gave <b>no</b> heed <b>to</b> anything else. Frodo began <b>to</b> listen.
<br>   At first <b>the</b> beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melodies <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little` held him in a spell, as soon as he began <b>to</b> attend <b>to</b> them. Almost <b>it</b> seemed that <b>the</b> words took shape, <b>and</b> visions <b>of</b> far lands <b>and</b> bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas <b>of</b> foam that sighed upon <b>the</b> margins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Then <b>the</b> enchantment became more <b>and</b> more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river <b>of</b> swelling gold <b>and</b> silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern <b>to</b> be comprehended; <b>it</b> became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throbbing air about him, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> drenched <b>and</b> drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight <b>into</b> a deep realm <b>of</b> sleep.
<br>   There he wandered long in a dream <b>of</b> music that turned <b>into</b> running water, <b>and</b> then suddenly <b>into</b> a voice. It seemed <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first <b>and</b> then clearer ran <b>the</b> words.
<br>   
<br>E?rendil was a mariner
<br>that tarried in Arvernien;
<br>he built a boat <b>of</b> timber felled
<br>in Nimbrethil <b>to</b> journey in;
<br>her sails he wove <b>of</b> silver fair,
<br><b>of</b> silver were her lanterns made,
<br>her prow was fashioned like a swan,
<br><b>and</b> light upon her banners laid.
<br>
<br>In panoply <b>of</b> ancient kings,
<br>in chain‚d rings he armoured him;
<br>his shining shield was scored with runes
<br><b>to</b> ward all wounds <b>and</b> harm from him;
<br>his bow was made <b>of</b> dragon-horn,
<br>his arrows shorn <b>of</b> ebony,
<br><b>of</b> silver was his habergeon,
<br>his scabbard <b>of</b> chalcedony;
<br>his sword <b>of</b> steel was valiant,
<br><b>of</b> adamant his helmet tall,
<br>an eagle-plume upon his crest,
<br>upon his breast an emerald.
<br>
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> Moon <b>and</b> under star
<br>he wandered far from northern strands,
<br>bewildered <b>on</b> enchanted ways
<br>beyond <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> mortal lands.
<br>From gnashing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Narrow Ice
<br>where shadow lies <b>on</b> frozen hills,
<br>from nether heats <b>and</b> burning waste
<br>he turned in haste, <b>and</b> roving still
<br><b>on</b> starless waters far astray
<br>at last he came <b>to</b> Night <b>of</b> Naught,
<br><b>and</b> passed, <b>and</b> never sight he saw
<br><b>of</b> shining shore nor light he sought.
<br>
<br>The winds <b>of</b> wrath came driving him,
<br><b>and</b> blindly in <b>the</b> foam he fled
<br>from west <b>to</b> east <b>and</b> errandless,
<br>unheralded he homeward sped.
<br>
<br>There flying Elwing came <b>to</b> him,
<br><b>and</b> flame was in <b>the</b> darkness lit;
<br>more bright than light <b>of</b> diamond
<br><b>the</b> fire upon her carcanet.
<br>The Silmaril she bound <b>on</b> him
<br><b>and</b> crowned him with <b>the</b> living light
<br><b>and</b> dauntless then with burning brow
<br>he turned his prow; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> night
<br>from Otherworld beyond <b>the</b> Sea
<br>there strong <b>and</b> free a storm arose,
<br>a wind <b>of</b> power in Tarmenel;
<br><b>by</b> paths that seldom mortal goes
<br>his boat <b>it</b> bore with biting breath
<br>as might <b>of</b> death across <b>the</b> grey
<br><b>and</b> long-forsaken seas distressed:
<br>from east <b>to</b> west he passed away.
<br>
<br>Through Evernight he back was borne
<br><b>on</b> black <b>and</b> roaring waves that ran
<br>o'er leagues unlit <b>and</b> foundered shores
<br>that drowned before <b>the</b> Days began,
<br>until he heard <b>on</b> strands <b>of</b> pearl
<br>when ends <b>the</b> world <b>the</b> music long,
<br>where ever foaming billows roll
<br><b>the</b> yellow gold <b>and</b> jewels wan.
<br>He saw <b>the</b> Mountain silent rise
<br>where twilight lies upon <b>the</b> knees
<br><b>of</b> Valinor, <b>and</b> Eldamar
<br>beheld afar beyond <b>the</b> seas.
<br>A wanderer escaped from night
<br><b>to</b> haven white he came at last,
<br><b>to</b> Elvenhome <b>the</b> green <b>and</b> fair
<br>where keen <b>the</b> air, where pale as glass
<br>beneath <b>the</b> Hill <b>of</b> Ilmarin
<br>a-glimmer in a valley sheer
<br><b>the</b> lamplit towers <b>of</b> Tirion
<br>are mirrored <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shadowmere.
<br>
<br>He tarried there from errantry,
<br><b>and</b> melodies they taught <b>to</b> him,
<br><b>and</b> sages old him marvels told,
<br><b>and</b> harps <b>of</b> gold they brought <b>to</b> him.
<br>They clothed him then in elven-white,
<br><b>and</b> seven lights before him sent,
<br>as through <b>the</b> Calacirian
<br><b>to</b> hidden land forlorn he went.
<br>He came unto <b>the</b> timeless halls
<br>where shining fall <b>the</b> countless years,
<br><b>and</b> endless reigns <b>the</b> Elder King
<br>in Ilmarin <b>on</b> Mountain sheer;
<br><b>and</b> words unheard were spoken then
<br><b>of</b> folk <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> Elven-kin,
<br>beyond <b>the</b> world were visions showed
<br>forbid <b>to</b> those that dwell therein.
<br>
<br>A ship then new they built for him
<br><b>of</b> mithril <b>and</b> <b>of</b> elven-glass
<br>with shining prow; <b>no</b> shaven oar
<br>nor sail she bore <b>on</b> silver mast:
<br><b>the</b> Silmaril as lantern light
<br><b>and</b> banner bright with living flame
<br><b>to</b> gleam thereon <b>by</b> Elbereth
<br>herself was set, who thither came
<br><b>and</b> wings immortal made for him,
<br><b>and</b> laid <b>on</b> him undying doom,
<br><b>to</b> sail <b>the</b> shoreless skies <b>and</b> come
<br>behind <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> light <b>of</b> Moon.
<br>
<br>From Evereven's lofty hills
<br>where softly silver fountains fall
<br>his wings him bore, a wandering light,
<br>beyond <b>the</b> mighty Mountain Wall.
<br>From World's End then he turned away
<br><b>and</b> yearned again <b>to</b> find afar
<br>his home through shadows journeying,
<br><b>and</b> burning as an island star
<br><b>on</b> high above <b>the</b> mists he came,
<br>a distant flame before <b>the</b> Sun,
<br>a wonder ere <b>the</b> waking dawn
<br>where grey <b>the</b> Norland waters run.
<br>
<br>And over Middle-earth he passed
<br><b>and</b> heard at last <b>the</b> weeping sore
<br><b>of</b> women <b>and</b> <b>of</b> elven-maids
<br>in Elder Days, in years <b>of</b> yore.
<br>gut <b>on</b> him mighty doom was laid,
<br>till Moon should fade, an orb‚d star
<br><b>to</b> pass, <b>and</b> tarry never more
<br><b>on</b> Hither Shores where mortals are;
<br>for ever still a herald <b>on</b>
<br>an errand that should never rest
<br><b>to</b> bear his shining lamp afar,
<br><b>the</b> Flammifer <b>of</b> Westernesse.
<br>   
<br>   The chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes <b>and</b> saw that Bilbo was seated <b>on</b> his stool in a circle <b>of</b> listeners, who were smiling <b>and</b> applauding.
<br>   “Now we had better have <b>it</b> again,” said an Elf.
<br>   Bilbo got up <b>and</b> bowed. “I am flattered, Lindir,” he said. “But <b>it</b> would be too tiring <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b> all.”
<br>   “Not too tiring for you,” <b>the</b> Elves answered laughing. “You know you are never tired <b>of</b> reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer your question at one hearing!”
<br>   “What!” cried Bilbo. “You can't tell which parts were mine, <b>and</b> which were <b>the</b> D?nadan's?”
<br>   “It is not easy for us <b>to</b> tell <b>the</b> difference between two mortals” said <b>the</b> Elf.
<br>   “Nonsense, Lindir,” snorted Bilbo. “If you can't distinguish between a Man <b>and</b> a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They're as different as peas <b>and</b> apples.”
<br>   “Maybe. To sheep other sheep <b>no</b> doubt appear different,” laughed Lindir. “Or <b>to</b> shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other business.”
<br>   “I won't argue with you,” said Bilbo. “I am sleepy after so much music <b>and</b> singing. I'll leave you <b>to</b> guess, if you want <b>to</b>.”
<br>   He got up <b>and</b> came towards Frodo. “Well, that's over,” he said in a low voice. “It went off better than I expected. I don't often get asked for a second hearing. What did you think <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “I am not going <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> guess,” said Frodo smiling.
<br>   “You needn't,” said Bilbo. “As a matter <b>of</b> fact <b>it</b> was all mine. Except that Aragorn insisted <b>on</b> my putting in a green stone. He seemed <b>to</b> think <b>it</b> important. I don't know why. Otherwise he obviously thought <b>the</b> whole thing rather above my head, <b>and</b> he said that if I had <b>the</b> cheek <b>to</b> make verses about E?rendil in <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>it</b> was my affair. I suppose he was right.”
<br>   “I don't know,” said Frodo. “It seemed <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> fit somehow, though I can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> follow <b>on</b> from something that I was dreaming about. I didn't understand that <b>it</b> was really you speaking until near <b>the</b> end.”
<br>   “It is difficult <b>to</b> keep awake here, until you get used <b>to</b> <b>it</b>;” said Bilbo. “Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite <b>the</b> elvish appetite for music <b>and</b> poetry <b>and</b> tales. They seem <b>to</b> like them as much as food, <b>or</b> more. They will be going <b>on</b> for a long time yet. What do you say <b>to</b> slipping off for some more quiet talk?”
<br>   “Can we?” said Frodo.
<br>   “Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come <b>and</b> go as you like, as long as you don't make a noise.”
<br>   They got up <b>and</b> withdrew quietly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows, <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile <b>on</b> his face. In spite <b>of</b> his delight in Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug <b>of</b> regret as they passed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fire. Even as they stepped over <b>the</b> threshold a single clear voice rose in song.
<br>   
<br>A Elbereth Gilthoniel,
<br>silivren penna m?riel
<br>o menel aglar elenath!
<br>Na-chaered palan-d?riel
<br>o galadhremmin ennorath,
<br>Fanuilos, le linnathon
<br>nef aear, s? nef aearon!
<br>   
<br>   Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire was <b>on</b> his face like summer-light upon <b>the</b> trees. Near him sat <b>the</b> Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his dark cloak was thrown back, <b>and</b> he seemed <b>to</b> be clad in elven-mail, <b>and</b> a star shone <b>on</b> his breast. They spoke together, <b>and</b> then suddenly <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> her eyes fell <b>on</b> him from afar <b>and</b> pierced his heart.
<br>   He stood still enchanted, while <b>the</b> sweet syllables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elvish song fell like clear jewels <b>of</b> blended word <b>and</b> melody. “It is a song <b>to</b> Elbereth,” said Bilbo. “They will sing that, <b>and</b> other songs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>   He led Frodo back <b>to</b> his own little room. It opened <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gar dens <b>and</b> looked south across <b>the</b> ravine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bruinen. There they sat for some while, looking through <b>the</b> window at <b>the</b> bright stars above <b>the</b> steep-climbing woods, <b>and</b> talking softly. They spoke <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire far away, nor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark shadows <b>and</b> perils that encompassed them, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fair things they had seen in <b>the</b> world together, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars, <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gentle fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bright year in <b>the</b> woods.
<br>   At last there came a knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. “Begging your pardon,” said Sam, putting in his head, “<b>but</b> I was just wondering if you would be wanting anything.”
<br>   “And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,” replied Bilbo. “I guess you mean that <b>it</b> is time your master went <b>to</b> bed.”
<br>   “Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear <b>and</b> he only got up today for <b>the</b> first time.”
<br>   “Quite right, Sam,” laughed Bilbo. “You can trot off <b>and</b> tell Gandalf that he has gone <b>to</b> bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> has been good <b>to</b> see you again! There are <b>no</b> folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk. I am getting very old, <b>and</b> I began <b>to</b> wonder if I should ever live <b>to</b> see your chapters <b>of</b> our story. Good night! I'll take a walk, I think, <b>and</b> look at <b>the</b> stars <b>of</b> Elbereth in <b>the</b> garden. Sleep well!”
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>THE COUNCIL OF ELROND
<br>
<br>   Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed <b>and</b> well. He walked along <b>the</b> terraces above <b>the</b> loud-flowing Bruinen <b>and</b> watched <b>the</b> pale, cool sun rise above <b>the</b> far mountains, <b>and</b> shine down. Slanting through <b>the</b> thin silver mist; <b>the</b> dew upon <b>the</b> yellow leaves was glimmering, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> woven nets <b>of</b> gossamer twinkled <b>on</b> every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying nothing. <b>but</b> sniffing <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> looking every now <b>and</b> again with wonder in his eyes at <b>the</b> great heights in <b>the</b> East. The snow was white upon their peaks.
<br>   On a seat cut in <b>the</b> stone beside a turn in <b>the</b> path they came upon Gandalf <b>and</b> Bilbo deep in talk. “Hullo! Good morning!” said Bilbo. “Feel ready for <b>the</b> great council?”
<br>   “I feel ready for anything,” answered Frodo. “But most <b>of</b> all I should like <b>to</b> go walking today <b>and</b> explore <b>the</b> valley. I should like <b>to</b> get <b>into</b> those pine-woods up there.” He pointed away far up <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north.
<br>   “You may have a chance later,” said Gandalf. “But we cannot make any plans yet. There is much <b>to</b> hear <b>and</b> decide today.”
<br>   Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. “That is <b>the</b> warning bell for <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> Elrond,” cried Gandalf. “Come along now! Both you <b>and</b> Bilbo are wanted.”
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Bilbo followed <b>the</b> wizard quickly along <b>the</b> winding path back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house; behind them, uninvited <b>and</b> for <b>the</b> moment forgotten, trotted Sam.
<br>   Gandalf led them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> porch where Frodo had found his friends <b>the</b> evening before. The light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clear autumn morning was now glowing in <b>the</b> valley. The noise <b>of</b> bubbling waters came up from <b>the</b> foaming river-bed. Birds were singing, <b>and</b> a wholesome peace lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land. To Frodo his dangerous flight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rumours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness growing in <b>the</b> world outside, already seemed only <b>the</b> memories <b>of</b> a troubled dream; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> faces that were turned <b>to</b> meet them as they entered were grave.
<br>   Elrond was there, <b>and</b> several others were seated in silence about him. Frodo saw Glorfindel <b>and</b> Gl?in; <b>and</b> in a corner alone Strider was sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo <b>to</b> a seat <b>by</b> his side, <b>and</b> presented him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company, saying:
<br>   “Here, my friends is <b>the</b> hobbit, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo. Few have ever come hither through greater peril <b>or</b> <b>on</b> an errand more urgent.”
<br>   He then pointed out <b>and</b> named those whom Frodo had not met before. There was a younger dwarf at Gl?in's side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors <b>of</b> Elrond's household, <b>of</b> whom Erestor was <b>the</b> chief; <b>and</b> with him was Galdor, an Elf from <b>the</b> Grey Havens who had come <b>on</b> an errand from C?rdan <b>the</b> Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf clad in green <b>and</b> brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair <b>and</b> noble face, dark-haired <b>and</b> grey-eyed, proud <b>and</b> stern <b>of</b> glance.
<br>   He was cloaked <b>and</b> booted as if for a journey <b>on</b> horseback; <b>and</b> indeed though his garments were rich, <b>and</b> his cloak was lined with fur, they were stained with long travel. He had a collar <b>of</b> silver in which a single white stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed at Frodo <b>and</b> Bilbo with sudden wonder.
<br>   “Here,” said Elrond, turning <b>to</b> Gandalf, “is Boromir, a man from <b>the</b> South. He arrived in <b>the</b> grey morning, <b>and</b> seeks for counsel. I have bidden him <b>to</b> be present, for here his questions will be answered.”
<br>   Not all that was spoken <b>and</b> debated in <b>the</b> Council need now be told. Much was said <b>of</b> events in <b>the</b> world outside, especially in <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> wide lands east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already heard many rumours; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Gl?in was new <b>to</b> him, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> dwarf spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid <b>the</b> splendour <b>of</b> their works <b>of</b> hand <b>the</b> hearts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain were troubled.
<br>   “It is now many years ago,” said Gl?in, “that a shadow <b>of</b> disquiet fell upon our people. Whence <b>it</b> came we did not at first perceive. Words began <b>to</b> be whispered in secret: <b>it</b> was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, <b>and</b> that greater wealth <b>and</b> splendour would be found in a wider world. Some spoke <b>of</b> Moria: <b>the</b> mighty works <b>of</b> our fathers that are called in our own tongue Khazad-d?m; <b>and</b> they declared that now at last we had <b>the</b> power <b>and</b> numbers <b>to</b> return.”
<br>   Gl?in sighed. “Moria! Moria! Wonder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern world! Too deep we delved there, <b>and</b> woke <b>the</b> nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain empty since <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> Durin fled. But now we spoke <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again with longing, <b>and</b> yet with dread; for <b>no</b> dwarf has dared <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> Khazad-d?m for many lives <b>of</b> kings, save Thr?r only, <b>and</b> he perished. At last, however, Balin listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whispers, <b>and</b> resolved <b>to</b> go; <b>and</b> though D?in did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori <b>and</b> ?in <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> our folk, <b>and</b> they went away south.
<br>   "That was nigh <b>on</b> thirty years ago. For a while we had news <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered <b>and</b> a great work begun there. Then there was silence, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> word has ever come from Moria since.
<br>   "Then about a year ago a messenger came <b>to</b> D?in, <b>but</b> not from Moria—from Mordor: a horseman in <b>the</b> night, who called D?in <b>to</b> his gate. The Lord Sauron <b>the</b> Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would give for <b>it</b>, such as he gave <b>of</b> old. And he asked urgently concerning hobbits, <b>of</b> what kind they were, <b>and</b> where they dwelt. “For Sauron knows,” said he, “that one <b>of</b> these was known <b>to</b> you <b>on</b> a time."
<br>   “At this we were greatly troubled, <b>and</b> we gave <b>no</b> answer. And then his fell voice was lowered, <b>and</b> he would have sweetened <b>it</b> if he could. “As a small token only <b>of</b> your friendship Sauron asks this,” he said: “that you should find this thief,” such was his word, “<b>and</b> get from him, willing <b>or</b> <b>no</b>, a little ring, <b>the</b> least <b>of</b> rings, that once he stole. It is <b>but</b> a trifle that Sauron fancies, <b>and</b> an earnest <b>of</b> your good will. Find <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> three rings that <b>the</b> Dwarf sires possessed <b>of</b> old shall be returned <b>to</b> you, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thief, whether he still lives <b>and</b> where, <b>and</b> you shall have great reward <b>and</b> lasting friendship from <b>the</b> Lord. Refuse, <b>and</b> things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?"
<br>   “At that his breath came like <b>the</b> hiss <b>of</b> snakes, <b>and</b> all who stood <b>by</b> shuddered, <b>but</b> D?in said: “I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this message <b>and</b> what <b>it</b> means under its fair cloak."
<br>   “Consider well, <b>but</b> not too long,” said he.
<br>   “The time <b>of</b> my thought is my own <b>to</b> spend,” answered D?in.
<br>   “For <b>the</b> present,” said he, <b>and</b> rode <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   “Heavy have <b>the</b> hearts <b>of</b> our chieftains been since that night. We needed not <b>the</b> fell voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> messenger <b>to</b> warn us that his words held both menace <b>and</b> deceit; for we knew already that <b>the</b> power that has re-entered Mordor has not changed, <b>and</b> ever <b>it</b> betrayed us <b>of</b> old. Twice <b>the</b> messenger has returned, <b>and</b> has gone unanswered. The third <b>and</b> last time, so he says, is soon <b>to</b> come, before <b>the</b> ending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year.
<br>   “And so I have been sent at last <b>by</b> D?in <b>to</b> warn Bilbo that he is sought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Enemy, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this least <b>of</b> rings. Also we crave <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> Elrond. For <b>the</b> Shadow grows <b>and</b> draws nearer. We discover that messengers have come also <b>to</b> King Brand in Dale, <b>and</b> that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is gathering <b>on</b> his eastern borders. If we make <b>no</b> answer, <b>the</b> Enemy may move Men <b>of</b> his rule <b>to</b> assail King Brand, <b>and</b> D?in also.”
<br>   “You have done well <b>to</b> come,” said Elrond. “You will hear today all that you need in order <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. There is naught that you can do, other than <b>to</b> resist, with hope <b>or</b> without <b>it</b>. But you do not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is <b>but</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trouble <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> western world. The Ring! What shall we do with <b>the</b> Ring, <b>the</b> least <b>of</b> rings, <b>the</b> trifle that Sauron fancies? That is <b>the</b> doom that we must deem.
<br>   “That is <b>the</b> purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say. though I have not called you <b>to</b> me, strangers from distant lands. You have come <b>and</b> are here met, in this very nick <b>of</b> time, <b>by</b> chance as <b>it</b> may seem. Yet <b>it</b> is not so. Believe rather that <b>it</b> is so ordered that we, who sit here, <b>and</b> none others, must now find counsel for <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.
<br>   “Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all <b>but</b> a few until this day. And first, so that all may understand what is <b>the</b> peril, <b>the</b> Tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring shall be told from <b>the</b> beginning even <b>to</b> this present. And I will begin that tale, though others shall end <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke <b>of</b> Sauron <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rings <b>of</b> Power, <b>and</b> their forging in <b>the</b> Second Age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world long ago. A part <b>of</b> his tale was known <b>to</b> some there, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> full tale <b>to</b> none, <b>and</b> many eyes were turned t= Elrond in fear <b>and</b> wonder as he told <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-smiths <b>of</b> Eregion <b>and</b> their friendship with Moria, <b>and</b> their eagerness for knowledge, <b>by</b> which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not yet evil <b>to</b> behold, <b>and</b> they received his aid <b>and</b> grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned all their secrets, <b>and</b> betrayed them, <b>and</b> forged secretly in <b>the</b> Mountain <b>of</b> Fire <b>the</b> One Ring <b>to</b> be their master. But Celebrimbor was aware <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> hid <b>the</b> Three which he had made; <b>and</b> there was war, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land was laid waste, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gate <b>of</b> Moria was shut.
<br>   Then through all <b>the</b> years that followed he traced <b>the</b> Ring; <b>but</b> since that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set <b>it</b> down in his books <b>of</b> lore, <b>it</b> is not here recalled. For <b>it</b> is a long tale, full <b>of</b> deeds great <b>and</b> terrible, <b>and</b> briefly though Elrond spoke, <b>the</b> sun rode up <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> morning was passing ere he ceased.
<br>   Of N?menor he spoke, its glory <b>and</b> its fall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> Men <b>to</b> Middle-earth out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, borne upon <b>the</b> wings <b>of</b> storm. Then Elendil <b>the</b> Tall <b>and</b> his mighty sons, Isildur <b>and</b> An?rion, became great lords; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> North-realm they made in Arnor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South-realm in Gondor above <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> Anduin. But Sauron <b>of</b> Mordor assailed them, <b>and</b> they made <b>the</b> Last Alliance <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hosts <b>of</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> Elendil were mustered in Arnor.
<br>   Thereupon Elrond paused a while <b>and</b> sighed. “I remember well <b>the</b> splendour <b>of</b> their banners,” he said. “It recalled <b>to</b> me <b>the</b> glory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hosts <b>of</b> Beleriand, so many great princes <b>and</b> captains were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was broken, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was not so.”
<br>   “You remember?” said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment. “But I thought,” he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, “I thought that <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Gil-galad was a long age ago.”
<br>   “So <b>it</b> was indeed,” answered Elrond gravely. “But my memory reaches back even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days. E?rendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin before its fall; <b>and</b> my mother was Elwing, daughter <b>of</b> Dior, son <b>of</b> L?thien <b>of</b> Doriath. I have seen three ages in <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>and</b> many defeats, <b>and</b> many fruitless victories.
<br>   “I was <b>the</b> herald <b>of</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> marched with his host. I was at <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Dagorlad before <b>the</b> Black Gate <b>of</b> Mordor, where we had <b>the</b> mastery: for <b>the</b> Spear <b>of</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sword <b>of</b> Elendil, Aiglos <b>and</b> Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld <b>the</b> last combat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, <b>and</b> Elendil fell, <b>and</b> Narsil broke beneath him; <b>but</b> Sauron himself was overthrown, <b>and</b> Isildur cut <b>the</b> Ring from his hand with <b>the</b> hilt-shard <b>of</b> his father's sword, <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> for his own.”
<br>   At this <b>the</b> stranger, Boromir, broke in. “So that is what became <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring!” he cried. “If ever such a tale was told in <b>the</b> South, <b>it</b> has long been forgotten. I have heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Ring <b>of</b> him that we do not name; <b>but</b> we believed that <b>it</b> perished from <b>the</b> world in <b>the</b> ruin <b>of</b> his first realm. Isildur took <b>it</b>! That is tidings indeed.”
<br>   “Alas! yes,” said Elrond. “Isildur took <b>it</b>, as should not have been. It should have been cast then <b>into</b> Orodruin's fire nigh at hand where <b>it</b> was made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood <b>by</b> his father in that last mortal contest; <b>and</b> <b>by</b> Gil-galad only C?rdan stood, <b>and</b> I. But Isildur would not listen <b>to</b> our counsel.
<br>   “This I will have as weregild for my father, <b>and</b> my brother,” he said; <b>and</b> therefore whether we would <b>or</b> <b>no</b>, he took <b>it</b> <b>to</b> treasure <b>it</b>. But soon he was betrayed <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his death; <b>and</b> so <b>it</b> is named in <b>the</b> North Isildur's Bane. Yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him.
<br>   “Only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North did these tidings come, <b>and</b> only <b>to</b> a few. Small wonder <b>it</b> is that you have not heard them, Boromir. From <b>the</b> ruin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back over <b>the</b> mountains after long wandering. One <b>of</b> these was Ohtar, <b>the</b> esquire <b>of</b> Isildur, who bore <b>the</b> shards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword <b>of</b> Elendil; <b>and</b> he brought them <b>to</b> Valandil, <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Isildur, who being <b>but</b> a child had remained here in Rivendell. But Narsil was broken <b>and</b> its light extinguished, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> has not yet been forged again.
<br>   “Fruitless did I call <b>the</b> victory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Alliance? Not wholly so, yet <b>it</b> did not achieve its end. Sauron was diminished, <b>but</b> not destroyed. His Ring was lost <b>but</b> not unmade. The Dark Tower was broken, <b>but</b> its foundations were not removed; for they were made with <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> while <b>it</b> remains they will endure. Many Elves <b>and</b> many mighty Men, <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> their friends. had perished in <b>the</b> war. An?rion was slain, <b>and</b> Isildur was slain; <b>and</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> Elendil were <b>no</b> more. Never again shall there be any such league <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men; for Men multiply <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Firstborn decrease, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that day <b>the</b> race <b>of</b> N?menor has decayed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> span <b>of</b> their years has lessened.
<br>   “In <b>the</b> North after <b>the</b> war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slaughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Westernesse were diminished, <b>and</b> their city <b>of</b> Ann?minas beside Lake Evendim fell <b>into</b> ruin; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heirs <b>of</b> Valandil removed <b>and</b> dwelt at Fornost <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high North Downs, <b>and</b> that now too is desolate. Men call <b>it</b> Deadmen's Dike, <b>and</b> they fear <b>to</b> tread there. For <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Arnor dwindled, <b>and</b> their foes devoured them, <b>and</b> their lordship passed, leaving only green mounds in <b>the</b> grassy hills.
<br>   “In <b>the</b> South <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> Gondor long endured; <b>and</b> for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> might <b>of</b> N?menor, ere <b>it</b> fell. High towers that people built, <b>and</b> strong places. <b>and</b> havens <b>of</b> many ships; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> winged crown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> Men was held in awe <b>by</b> folk <b>of</b> many tongues. Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stars. through <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> River flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Shadow; <b>and</b> westward at <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Setting Sun. There in <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King grew a white tree, from <b>the</b> seed <b>of</b> that tree which Isildur brought over <b>the</b> deep waters, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seed <b>of</b> that tree before came from Eress?a, <b>and</b> before that out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uttermost West in <b>the</b> Day before days when <b>the</b> world was young.
<br>   “But in <b>the</b> wearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swift years <b>of</b> Middle-earth <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> Meneldil son <b>of</b> An?rion failed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tree withered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N?menoreans became mingled with that <b>of</b> lesser men. Then <b>the</b> watch upon <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> Mordor slept, <b>and</b> dark things crept back <b>to</b> Gorgoroth. And <b>on</b> a time evil things came forth, <b>and</b> they took Minas Ithil <b>and</b> abode in <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> they made <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a place <b>of</b> dread; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is called Minas Morgul, <b>the</b> Tower <b>of</b> Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, <b>the</b> Tower <b>of</b> Guard; <b>and</b> these two cities were ever at war, <b>but</b> Osgiliath which lay between was deserted <b>and</b> in its ruins shadows walked.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> has been for many lives <b>of</b> men. But <b>the</b> Lords <b>of</b> Minas Tirith still fight <b>on</b>, defying our enemies, keeping <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River from Argonath <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea. And now that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale that I shall tell is drawn <b>to</b> its close. For in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Isildur <b>the</b> Ruling Ring passed out <b>of</b> all knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Three were released from its dominion. But now in this latter day they are in peril once more, for <b>to</b> our sorrow <b>the</b> One has been found. Others shall speak <b>of</b> its finding, for in that I played small part.”
<br>   He ceased, <b>but</b> at once Boromir stood up, tall <b>and</b> proud, before them. Give me leave, Master Elrond, said he, first <b>to</b> say more <b>of</b> Gondor; for verily from <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Gondor I am come. And <b>it</b> would be well for all <b>to</b> know what passes there. For few, I deem, know <b>of</b> our deeds, <b>and</b> therefore guess little <b>of</b> their peril, if we should fail at last.
<br>   “Believe not that in <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Gondor <b>the</b> blood <b>of</b> N?menor is spent, nor all its pride <b>and</b> dignity forgotten. By our valour <b>the</b> wild folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East are still restrained, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> Morgul kept at bay; <b>and</b> thus alone are peace <b>and</b> freedom maintained in <b>the</b> lands behind us, bulwark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. But if <b>the</b> passages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River should be won, what then?
<br>   “Yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has arisen again. Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom. The power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Land grows <b>and</b> we are hard beset. When <b>the</b> Enemy returned our folk were driven from Ithilien, our fair domain east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, though we kept a foothold there <b>and</b> strength <b>of</b> arms. But this very year, in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> June, sudden war came upon us out <b>of</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> we were swept away. We were outnumbered, for Mordor has allied itself with <b>the</b> Easterlings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cruel Haradrim; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was not <b>by</b> numbers that we were defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before.
<br>   “Some said that <b>it</b> could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark shadow under <b>the</b> moon. Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, <b>but</b> fear fell <b>on</b> our boldest, so that horse <b>and</b> man gave way <b>and</b> fled. Only a remnant <b>of</b> our eastern force came back, destroying <b>the</b> last bridge that still stood amid <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> Osgiliath.
<br>   “I was in <b>the</b> company that held <b>the</b> bridge, until <b>it</b> was cast down behind us. Four only were saved <b>by</b> swimming: my brother <b>and</b> myself <b>and</b> two others. But still we fight <b>on</b>, holding all <b>the</b> west shores <b>of</b> Anduin; <b>and</b> those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much praise <b>but</b> little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride <b>to</b> us when we call.
<br>   “In this evil hour I have come <b>on</b> an errand over many dangerous leagues <b>to</b> Elrond: a hundred <b>and</b> ten days I have journeyed all alone. But I do not seek allies in war. The might <b>of</b> Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, <b>it</b> is said. I come <b>to</b> ask for counsel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unravelling <b>of</b> hard words. For <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sudden assault a dream came <b>to</b> my brother in a troubled sleep; <b>and</b> afterwards a like dream came oft <b>to</b> him again, <b>and</b> once <b>to</b> me.
<br>   “In that dream I thought <b>the</b> eastern sky grew dark <b>and</b> there was a growing thunder, <b>but</b> in <b>the</b> West a pale light lingered, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> I heard a voice, remote <b>but</b> clear, crying:
<br>   
<br>Seek for <b>the</b> Sword that was broken:
<br>In Imladris <b>it</b> dwells;
<br>There shall be counsels taken
<br>Stronger than Morgul-spells.
<br>There shall be shown a token
<br>That Doom is near at hand,
<br>For Isildur's Bane shall waken,
<br>And <b>the</b> Halfling forth shall stand.
<br>   
<br>   Of these words we could understand little, <b>and</b> we spoke <b>to</b> our father, Denethor, Lord <b>of</b> Minas Tirith, wise in <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> Gondor. This only would he say, that Imladris was <b>of</b> old <b>the</b> name among <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> a far northern dale, where Elrond <b>the</b> Halfelven dwelt, greatest <b>of</b> lore-masters. Therefore my brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager <b>to</b> heed <b>the</b> dream <b>and</b> seek for Imladris; <b>but</b> since <b>the</b> way was full <b>of</b> doubt <b>and</b> danger, I took <b>the</b> journey upon myself. Loth was my father <b>to</b> give me leave, <b>and</b> long have I wandered <b>by</b> roads forgotten, seeking <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>of</b> which many had heard, <b>but</b> few knew where <b>it</b> lay.”
<br>   “And here in <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond more shall be made clear <b>to</b> you” said Aragorn, standing up. He cast his sword upon <b>the</b> table that stood before Elrond, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blade was in two pieces. “Here is <b>the</b> Sword that was Broken!” he said.
<br>   “And who are you, <b>and</b> what have you <b>to</b> do with Minas Tirith?” asked Boromir, looking in wonder at <b>the</b> lean face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ranger <b>and</b> his weather-stained cloak.
<br>   “He is Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn,” said Elrond; “<b>and</b> he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son <b>of</b> Minas Ithil. He is <b>the</b> Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain in <b>the</b> North, <b>and</b> few are now left <b>of</b> that folk.”
<br>   “Then <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> you, <b>and</b> not <b>to</b> me at all!” cried Frodo in amazement, springing <b>to</b> his feet, as if he expected <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> be demanded at once.
<br>   “It does not belong <b>to</b> either <b>of</b> us,” said Aragorn; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> has been ordained that you should hold <b>it</b> for a while.”
<br>   “Bring out <b>the</b> Ring, Frodo!” said Gandalf solemnly. “The time has come. Hold <b>it</b> up, <b>and</b> then Boromir will understand <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> his riddle.”
<br>   There was a hush, <b>and</b> all turned their eyes <b>on</b> Frodo. He was shaken <b>by</b> a sudden shame <b>and</b> fear; <b>and</b> he felt a great reluctance <b>to</b> reveal <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> a loathing <b>of</b> its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed <b>and</b> flickered as he held <b>it</b> up before them in his trembling hand.
<br>   “Behold Isildur's Bane!” said Elrond.
<br>   Boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at <b>the</b> golden thing. “The Halfling!” he muttered. “Is then <b>the</b> doom <b>of</b> Minas Tirith come at last? But why then should we seek a broken sword?”
<br>   “The words were not <b>the</b> doom <b>of</b> Minas Tirith,” said Aragorn. “But doom <b>and</b> great deeds are indeed at hand. For <b>the</b> Sword that was Broken is <b>the</b> Sword <b>of</b> Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured <b>by</b> his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for <b>it</b> was spoken <b>of</b> old among us that <b>it</b> should be made again when <b>the</b> Ring, Isildur's Bane, was found. Now you have seen <b>the</b> sword that you have sought, what would you ask? Do you wish for <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elendil <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Gondor?”
<br>   “I was not sent <b>to</b> beg any boon, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> seek only <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> a riddle,” answered Boromir proudly. “Yet we are hard pressed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sword <b>of</b> Elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed return out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.” He looked again at Aragorn, <b>and</b> doubt was in his eyes.
<br>   Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed <b>on</b> his friend's behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out:
<br>   
<br>All that is gold does not glitter,
<br>Not all those who wander are lost;
<br>The old that is strong does not wither,
<br>Deep roots are not reached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> frost.
<br>
<br>From <b>the</b> ashes a fire shall be woken,
<br>A light from <b>the</b> shadows shall spring;
<br>Renewed shall be blade that was broken:
<br>The crownless again shall be king.
<br>   
<br>   “Not very good perhaps, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point—if you need more beyond <b>the</b> word <b>of</b> Elrond. If that was worth a journey <b>of</b> a hundred <b>and</b> ten days <b>to</b> hear, you had best listen <b>to</b> <b>it</b>.” He sat down with a snort.
<br>   “I made that up myself,” he whispered <b>to</b> Frodo, “for <b>the</b> D?nadan, a long time ago when he first told me about himself. I almost wish that my adventures were not over, <b>and</b> that I could go with him when his day comes.”
<br>   Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned <b>to</b> Boromir again. “For my part I forgive your doubt,” he said. “Little do I resemble <b>the</b> figures <b>of</b> Elendil <b>and</b> Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in <b>the</b> halls <b>of</b> Denethor. I am <b>but</b> <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Isildur, not Isildur himself. I have had a hard life <b>and</b> a long; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leagues that lie between here <b>and</b> Gondor are a small part in <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> my journeys. I have crossed many mountains <b>and</b> many rivers, <b>and</b> trodden many plains, even <b>into</b> <b>the</b> far countries <b>of</b> Rh?n <b>and</b> Harad where <b>the</b> stars are strange.
<br>   “But my home, such as I have, is in <b>the</b> North. For here <b>the</b> heirs <b>of</b> Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations. Our days have darkened, <b>and</b> we have dwindled; <b>but</b> ever <b>the</b> Sword has passed <b>to</b> a new keeper. And this I will say <b>to</b> you, Boromir, ere I end. Lonely men are we, Rangers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild, hunters—<b>but</b> hunters ever <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor only.
<br>   “If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls <b>and</b> bright swords do not stay. You know little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lands beyond your bounds. Peace <b>and</b> freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little <b>but</b> for us. Fear would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from <b>the</b> houseless hills, <b>or</b> creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any dare <b>to</b> tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, <b>or</b> in <b>the</b> homes <b>of</b> simple men at night, if <b>the</b> D?nedain were asleep, <b>or</b> were all gone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grave?
<br>   “And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, <b>and</b> countrymen give us scornful names. “Strider” I am <b>to</b> one fat man who lives within a day's march <b>of</b> foes that would freeze his heart <b>or</b> lay his little town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have <b>it</b> otherwise. If simple folk are free from care <b>and</b> fear, simple they will be, <b>and</b> we must be secret <b>to</b> keep them so. That has been <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> my kindred, while <b>the</b> years have lengthened <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grass has grown.
<br>   “But now <b>the</b> world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur's Bane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword shall be reforged. I will come <b>to</b> Minas Tirith.”
<br>   “Isildur's Bane is found, you say,” said Boromir. “I have seen a bright ring in <b>the</b> Halfling's hand; <b>but</b> Isildur perished ere this age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world began, they say. How do <b>the</b> Wise know that this ring is his? And how has <b>it</b> passed down <b>the</b> years, until <b>it</b> is brought hither <b>by</b> so strange a messenger?”
<br>   “That shall be told,” said Elrond.
<br>   “But not yet, I beg, Master!” said Bilbo. “Already <b>the</b> Sun is climbing <b>to</b> noon, <b>and</b> I feel <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> something <b>to</b> strengthen me.”
<br>   “I had not named you,” said Elrond smiling. “But I do so now. Come! Tell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story <b>into</b> verse, you may tell <b>it</b> in plain words. The briefer, <b>the</b> sooner shall you be refreshed.”
<br>   “Very well,” said Bilbo. “I will do as you bid. But I will now tell <b>the</b> true story, <b>and</b> if some here have heard me tell <b>it</b> otherwise”—he looked sidelong at Gl?in—`I ask them <b>to</b> forget <b>it</b> <b>and</b> forgive me. I only wished <b>to</b> claim <b>the</b> treasure as my very own in those days, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> thief that was put <b>on</b> me. But perhaps I understand things a little better now. Anyway, this is what happened.”
<br>   To some there Bilbo's tale was wholly new, <b>and</b> they listened with amazement while <b>the</b> old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. He would have given also an account <b>of</b> his party <b>and</b> disappearance from <b>the</b> Shire, if he had been allowed; <b>but</b> Elrond raised his hand.
<br>   “Well told, my friend,” he said, “<b>but</b> that is enough at this time. For <b>the</b> moment <b>it</b> suffices <b>to</b> know that <b>the</b> Ring passed <b>to</b> Frodo, your heir. Let him now speak!”
<br>   Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told <b>of</b> all his dealings with <b>the</b> Ring from <b>the</b> day that <b>it</b> passed <b>into</b> his keeping. Every step <b>of</b> his journey from Hobbiton <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen was questioned <b>and</b> considered, <b>and</b> everything that he could recall concerning <b>the</b> Black Riders was examined. At last he sat down again.
<br>   “Not bad,” Bilbo said <b>to</b> him. “You would have made a good story <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, if they hadn't kept <b>on</b> interrupting. I tried <b>to</b> make a few notes, <b>but</b> we shall have <b>to</b> go over <b>it</b> all again together some time, if I am <b>to</b> write <b>it</b> up. There are whole chapters <b>of</b> stuff before you ever got here!”
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> made quite a long tale,” answered Frodo. “But <b>the</b> story still does not seem complete <b>to</b> me. I still want <b>to</b> know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.”
<br>   Galdor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Havens, who sat near <b>by</b>, overheard him. “You speak for me also,” he cried, <b>and</b> turning <b>to</b> Elrond he said: “The Wise may have good reason <b>to</b> believe that <b>the</b> halfling's trove is indeed <b>the</b> Great Ring <b>of</b> long debate, unlikely though that may seem <b>to</b> those who know less. But may we not hear <b>the</b> proofs? And I would ask this also. What <b>of</b> Saruman? He is learned in <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he knows <b>the</b> things that we have heard?”
<br>   “The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,” said Elrond. “I had not overlooked them, <b>and</b> they shall be answered. But these things <b>it</b> is <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>to</b> make clear; <b>and</b> I call upon him last, for <b>it</b> is <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> honour, <b>and</b> in all this matter he has been <b>the</b> chief.”
<br>   “Some, Galdor,” said Gandalf, “would think <b>the</b> tidings <b>of</b> Gl?in, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> Frodo, proof enough that <b>the</b> halfling's trove is a thing <b>of</b> great worth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Yet <b>it</b> is a ring. What then? The Nine <b>the</b> Nazg?l keep. The Seven are taken <b>or</b> destroyed.” At this Gl?in stirred, <b>but</b> did not speak. “The Three we know <b>of</b>. What then is this one that he desires so much?
<br>   “There is indeed a wide waste <b>of</b> time between <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountain, between <b>the</b> loss <b>and</b> <b>the</b> finding. But <b>the</b> gap in <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For <b>the</b> Enemy has been close behind, closer even than I feared. And well is <b>it</b> that not until this year, this very summer, as <b>it</b> seems, did he learn <b>the</b> full truth.
<br>   “Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Necromancer in Dol Guldur, <b>and</b> secretly explored his ways, <b>and</b> found thus that our fears were true: he was none other than Sauron, our Enemy <b>of</b> old, at length taking shape <b>and</b> power again. Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, <b>and</b> for long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Council put forth its strength <b>and</b> drove <b>the</b> evil out <b>of</b> Mirkwood <b>and</b> that was in <b>the</b> very year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> this Ring: a strange chance, if chance <b>it</b> was.
<br>   “But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us, <b>and</b> had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he gave way before us, <b>but</b> only feigned <b>to</b> flee, <b>and</b> soon after came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower <b>and</b> openly declared himself. Then for <b>the</b> last time <b>the</b> Council met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for <b>the</b> One. We feared then that he had some news <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that we knew nothing <b>of</b>. But Saruman said nay, <b>and</b> repeated what he had said <b>to</b> us before: that <b>the</b> One would never again be found in Middle-earth.
<br>   “At <b>the</b> worst,” said he, “our Enemy knows that we have <b>it</b> not <b>and</b> that <b>it</b> still is lost. But what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into Anduin <b>the</b> Great <b>it</b> fell; <b>and</b> long ago, while Sauron slept, <b>it</b> was rolled down <b>the</b> River <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea. There let <b>it</b> lie until <b>the</b> End.”
<br>   Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from <b>the</b> porch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> far peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, at whose great roots <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world had so long lain hidden. He sighed.
<br>   “There I was at fault,” he said. “I was lulled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Saruman <b>the</b> Wise; <b>but</b> I should have sought for <b>the</b> truth sooner, <b>and</b> our peril would now be less.”
<br>   “We were all at fault,” said Elrond, “<b>and</b> <b>but</b> for your vigilance <b>the</b> Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say <b>on</b>!”
<br>   “From <b>the</b> first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> I desired <b>to</b> know how this thing came <b>to</b> Gollum, <b>and</b> how long he had possessed <b>it</b>. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness <b>to</b> seek for his treasure. He came, <b>but</b> he escaped <b>and</b> was not found. And then alas! I let <b>the</b> matter rest, watching <b>and</b> waiting only, as we have too often done.
<br>   “Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again <b>to</b> sudden fear. Whence came <b>the</b> hobbit's ring? What, if my fear was true, should be done with <b>it</b>? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet <b>of</b> my dread <b>to</b> none, knowing <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> an untimely whisper, if <b>it</b> went astray. In all <b>the</b> long wars with <b>the</b> Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe.
<br>   “That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies <b>of</b> many sorts, even beasts <b>and</b> birds, were gathered round <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> my fear grew. I called for <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain, <b>and</b> their watch was doubled; <b>and</b> I opened my heart <b>to</b> Aragorn, <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Isildur.”
<br>   “And I,” said Aragorn, “counselled that we should hunt for Gollum. too late though <b>it</b> may seem. And since <b>it</b> seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour <b>to</b> repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long <b>and</b> hopeless search.”
<br>   Then Gandalf told how they had explored <b>the</b> whole length <b>of</b> Wilderland, down even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Shadow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fences <b>of</b> Mordor. “There we had rumour <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> we guess that he dwelt there long in <b>the</b> dark hills; <b>but</b> we never found him, <b>and</b> at last I despaired. And then in my despair I thought again <b>of</b> a test that might make <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> Gollum unneeded. The ring itself might tell if <b>it</b> were <b>the</b> One. The memory <b>of</b> words at <b>the</b> Council came back <b>to</b> me: words <b>of</b> Saruman, half-heeded at <b>the</b> time. I heard them now clearly in my heart.
<br>   “The Nine, <b>the</b> Seven, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Three,” he said, “had each their proper gem. Not so <b>the</b> One. It was round <b>and</b> unadorned, as <b>it</b> were one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesser rings; <b>but</b> its maker set marks upon <b>it</b> that <b>the</b> skilled, maybe, could still see <b>and</b> read."
<br>   “What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The maker. And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, <b>it</b> must have a source. What hand save Sauron's ever held this thing, ere <b>it</b> was lost? The hand <b>of</b> Isildur alone.
<br>   “With that thought, I forsook <b>the</b> chase, <b>and</b> passed swiftly <b>to</b> Gondor. In former days <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> my order had been well received there, <b>but</b> Saruman most <b>of</b> all. Often he had been for long <b>the</b> guest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City. Less welcome did <b>the</b> Lord Denethor show me then than <b>of</b> old, <b>and</b> grudgingly he permitted me <b>to</b> search among his hoarded scrolls <b>and</b> books.
<br>   “If indeed you look only, as you say, for records <b>of</b> ancient days, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beginnings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City, read <b>on</b>!” he said. “For <b>to</b> me what was is less dark than what is <b>to</b> come, <b>and</b> that is my care. But unless you have more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find naught that is not well known <b>to</b> me, who am master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> this City."
<br>   “So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now can read, even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lore-masters, for their scripts <b>and</b> tongues have become dark <b>to</b> later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, <b>by</b> any save Saruman <b>and</b> myself since <b>the</b> kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away straight from <b>the</b> war in Mordor, as some have told <b>the</b> tale.”
<br>   “Some in <b>the</b> North, maybe,” Boromir broke in. “All know in Gondor that he went first <b>to</b> Minas Anor <b>and</b> dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil, instructing him, before he committed <b>to</b> him <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Kingdom. In that time he planted there <b>the</b> last sapling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Tree in memory <b>of</b> his brother.”
<br>   “But in that time also he made this scroll,” said Gandalf; “<b>and</b> that is not remembered in Gondor, <b>it</b> would seem. For this scroll concerns <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> thus wrote Isildur therein:
<br>   The Great Ring shall go now <b>to</b> be an heirloom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Kingdom; <b>but</b> records <b>of</b> <b>it</b> shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell <b>the</b> heirs <b>of</b> Elendil, lest a time come when <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> these great matters shall grow dim.
<br>   “And after these words Isildur described <b>the</b> Ring, such as he found <b>it</b>.
<br>   It was hot when I first took <b>it</b>, hot as a glede, <b>and</b> my hand was scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pain <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Yet even as I write <b>it</b> is cooled, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemeth <b>to</b> shrink, though <b>it</b> loseth neither its beauty nor its shape. Already <b>the</b> writing upon <b>it</b>, which at first was as clear as red flame, fadeth <b>and</b> is now only barely <b>to</b> be read. It is fashioned in an elven-script <b>of</b> Eregion, for they have <b>no</b> letters in Mordor for such subtle work; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> language is unknown <b>to</b> me. I deem <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a tongue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Land, since <b>it</b> is foul <b>and</b> uncouth. What evil <b>it</b> saith I do not know; <b>but</b> I trace here a copy <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, lest <b>it</b> fade beyond recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, <b>the</b> heat <b>of</b> Sauron's hand, which was black <b>and</b> yet burned like fire, <b>and</b> so Gil-galad was destroyed; <b>and</b> maybe were <b>the</b> gold made hot again, <b>the</b> writing would be refreshed. But for my part I will risk <b>no</b> hurt <b>to</b> this thing: <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> Sauron <b>the</b> only fair. It is precious <b>to</b> me, though I buy <b>it</b> with great pain.
<br>   “When I read these words, my quest was ended. For <b>the</b> traced writing was indeed as Isildur guessed, in <b>the</b> tongue <b>of</b> Mordor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tower. And what was said therein was already known. For in <b>the</b> day that Sauron first put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> One, Celebrimbor, maker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three, was aware <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> from afar he heard him speak these words, <b>and</b> so his evil purposes were revealed.
<br>   “At once I took my leave <b>of</b> Denethor, <b>but</b> even as I went northwards, messages came <b>to</b> me out <b>of</b> L?rien that Aragorn had passed that way, <b>and</b> that he had found <b>the</b> creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first <b>to</b> meet him <b>and</b> hear his tale. Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not guess.”
<br>   “There is little need <b>to</b> tell <b>of</b> them,” said Aragorn. “If a man must needs walk in sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Gate, <b>or</b> tread <b>the</b> deadly flowers <b>of</b> Morgul Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, <b>and</b> I began my homeward journey. And then, <b>by</b> fortune, I came suddenly <b>on</b> what I sought: <b>the</b> marks <b>of</b> soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now <b>the</b> trail was fresh <b>and</b> swift, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> led not <b>to</b> Mordor <b>but</b> away. Along <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead Marshes I followed <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> then I had him. Lurking <b>by</b> a stagnant mere, peering in <b>the</b> water as <b>the</b> dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was covered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, <b>and</b> I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than <b>the</b> marks <b>of</b> his teeth. I deemed <b>it</b> <b>the</b> worst part <b>of</b> all my journey, <b>the</b> road back, watching him day <b>and</b> night, making him walk before me with a halter <b>on</b> his neck, gagged, until he was tamed <b>by</b> lack <b>of</b> drink <b>and</b> food, driving him ever towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last <b>and</b> gave him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elves, for we had agreed that this should be done; <b>and</b> I was glad <b>to</b> be rid <b>of</b> his company, for he stank. For my part I hope never <b>to</b> look upon him again; <b>but</b> Gandalf came <b>and</b> endured long speech with him.”
<br>   “Yes, long <b>and</b> weary,” said Gandalf, “<b>but</b> not without profit. For one thing, <b>the</b> tale he told <b>of</b> his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now told openly for <b>the</b> first time; <b>but</b> that mattered little, since I had already guessed <b>it</b>. But I learned then first that Gollum's ring came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River nigh <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had possessed <b>it</b> long. Many lives <b>of</b> his small kind. The power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span; <b>but</b> that power only <b>the</b> Great Rings wield.
<br>   “And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is <b>the</b> other test that I spoke <b>of</b>. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round <b>and</b> unadorned, <b>the</b> letters that Isildur reported may still be read, if one has <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> will <b>to</b> set <b>the</b> golden thing in <b>the</b> fire a while. That I have done, <b>and</b> this I have read:
<br>   Ash nazg durbatul?k, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul?k agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.”
<br>   The change in <b>the</b> wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly <b>it</b> became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed <b>to</b> pass over <b>the</b> high sun, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves stopped their ears.
<br>   “Never before has any voice dared <b>to</b> utter <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> that tongue in Imladris, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey,” said Elrond, as <b>the</b> shadow passed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> company breathed once more.
<br>   “And let us hope that none will ever speak <b>it</b> here again,” answered Gandalf. “Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that tongue is not soon <b>to</b> be heard in every corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what <b>the</b> Wise have declared: <b>the</b> treasure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy, fraught with all his malice; <b>and</b> in <b>it</b> lies a great part <b>of</b> his strength <b>of</b> old. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Years come <b>the</b> words that <b>the</b> Smiths <b>of</b> Eregion heard, <b>and</b> knew that they had been betrayed:
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all, One Ring <b>to</b> find them, One Ring <b>to</b> bring them all <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> Darkness bind them.
<br>   “Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was loth <b>to</b> speak <b>and</b> his tale was unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is beyond all doubt that he went <b>to</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> there all that he knew was forced from him. Thus <b>the</b> Enemy knows now that <b>the</b> One is found, that <b>it</b> was long in <b>the</b> Shire; <b>and</b> since his servants have pursued <b>it</b> almost <b>to</b> our door, he soon will know, already he may know, even as I speak, that we have <b>it</b> here.”
<br>   All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. “He is a small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, <b>but</b> great in mischief. What became <b>of</b> him? To what doom did you put him?”
<br>   “He is in prison, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> worse,” said Aragorn. “He had suffered much. There is <b>no</b> doubt that he was tormented, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> Sauron lies black <b>on</b> his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept <b>by</b> <b>the</b> watchful Elves <b>of</b> Mirkwood. His malice is great <b>and</b> gives him a strength hardly <b>to</b> be believed in one so lean <b>and</b> withered. He could work much mischief still, if he were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed <b>to</b> leave Mordor <b>on</b> some evil errand.”
<br>   “Alas! alas!” cried Legolas, <b>and</b> in his fair elvish face there was great distress. “The tidings that I was sent <b>to</b> bring must now be told. They are not good, <b>but</b> only here have I learned how evil they may seem <b>to</b> this company. Sm?agol, who is now called Gollum, has escaped.”
<br>   “Escaped?” cried Aragorn. “That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue <b>it</b> bitterly, I fear. How came <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Thranduil <b>to</b> fail in their trust?”
<br>   “Not through lack <b>of</b> watchfulness,” said Legolas; “<b>but</b> perhaps through over-kindliness. And we fear that <b>the</b> prisoner had aid from others, <b>and</b> that more is known <b>of</b> our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day <b>and</b> night, at Gandalf's bidding, much though we wearied <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task. But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, <b>and</b> we had not <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> keep him ever in dungeons under <b>the</b> earth, where he would fall back <b>into</b> his old black thoughts.”
<br>   “You were less tender <b>to</b> me,” said Gl?in with a flash <b>of</b> his eyes as old memories were stirred <b>of</b> his imprisonment in <b>the</b> deep places <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-king's halls.
<br>   “Now come!” said Gandalf. “Pray do not interrupt, my good Gl?in. That was a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If all <b>the</b> grievances that stand between Elves <b>and</b> Dwarves are <b>to</b> be brought up here, we may as well abandon this Council.”
<br>   Gl?in rose <b>and</b> bowed, <b>and</b> Legolas continued. “In <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> fair weather we led Gollum through <b>the</b> woods; <b>and</b> there was a high tree standing alone far from <b>the</b> others which he liked <b>to</b> climb. Often we let him mount up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highest branches, until he felt <b>the</b> free wind; <b>but</b> we set a guard at <b>the</b> tree's foot. One day he refused <b>to</b> come down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guards had <b>no</b> mind <b>to</b> climb after him: he had learned <b>the</b> trick <b>of</b> clinging <b>to</b> boughs with his feet as well as with his hands; so they sat <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tree far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   “It was that very night <b>of</b> summer, yet moonless <b>and</b> starless, that Orcs came <b>on</b> us at unawares. We drove them off after some time; they were many <b>and</b> fierce, <b>but</b> they came from over <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> were unused <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods. When <b>the</b> battle was over, we found that Gollum was gone, <b>and</b> his guards were slain <b>or</b> taken. It then seemed plain <b>to</b> us that <b>the</b> attack had been made for his rescue, <b>and</b> that he knew <b>of</b> <b>it</b> beforehand. How that was contrived we cannot guess; <b>but</b> Gollum is cunning, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy are many. The dark things that were driven out in <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dragon's fall have returned in greater numbers, <b>and</b> Mirkwood is again an evil place, save where our realm is maintained.
<br>   “We have failed <b>to</b> recapture Gollum. We came <b>on</b> his trail among those <b>of</b> many Orcs, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> plunged deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Forest, going south. But ere long <b>it</b> escaped our skill, <b>and</b> we dared not continue <b>the</b> hunt; for we were drawing nigh <b>to</b> Dol Guldur, <b>and</b> that is still a very evil place; we do not go that way.”
<br>   “Well, well, he is gone,” said Gandalf. “We have <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> seek for him again. He must do what he will. But he may play a part yet that neither he nor Sauron have foreseen.
<br>   “And now I will answer Galdor's other questions. What <b>of</b> Saruman? What are his counsels <b>to</b> us in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only Elrond has heard <b>it</b> yet, <b>and</b> that in brief, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> will bear <b>on</b> all that we must resolve. It is <b>the</b> last chapter in <b>the</b> Tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, so far as <b>it</b> has yet gone.
<br>   “At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> June I was in <b>the</b> Shire, <b>but</b> a cloud <b>of</b> anxiety was <b>on</b> my mind, <b>and</b> I rode <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little land; for I had a foreboding <b>of</b> some danger, still hidden from me <b>but</b> drawing near. There messages reached me telling me <b>of</b> war <b>and</b> defeat in Gondor, <b>and</b> when I heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few fugitives from <b>the</b> South; yet <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me that <b>on</b> them sat a fear <b>of</b> which they would not speak. I turned then east <b>and</b> north <b>and</b> journeyed along <b>the</b> Greenway; <b>and</b> not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting <b>on</b> a bank beside <b>the</b> road with his grazing horse beside him. It was Radagast <b>the</b> Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Mirkwood. He is one <b>of</b> my order, <b>but</b> I had not seen him for many a year.
<br>   “Gandalf!” he cried. “I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in these parts. All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with <b>the</b> uncouth name <b>of</b> Shire."
<br>   “Your information was correct,” I said. “But do not put <b>it</b> that way, if you meet any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants. You are near <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire now. And what do you want with me? It must be pressing. You were never a traveller, unless driven <b>by</b> great need."
<br>   “I have an urgent errand,” he said. “My news is evil.” Then he looked about him, as if <b>the</b> hedges might have ears. “Nazg?l,” he whispered. “The Nine are abroad again. They have crossed <b>the</b> River secretly <b>and</b> are moving westward. They have taken <b>the</b> guise <b>of</b> riders in black."
<br>   “I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing <b>it</b>.
<br>   “The enemy must have some great need <b>or</b> purpose,” said Radagast; “<b>but</b> what <b>it</b> is that makes him look <b>to</b> these distant <b>and</b> desolate parts, I cannot guess."
<br>   “What do you mean?” said I.
<br>   “I have been told that wherever they go <b>the</b> Riders ask for news <b>of</b> a land called Shire."
<br>   “The Shire,” I said; <b>but</b> my heart sank. For even <b>the</b> Wise might fear <b>to</b> withstand <b>the</b> Nine, when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain. A great king <b>and</b> sorcerer he was <b>of</b> old, <b>and</b> now he wields a deadly fear. “Who told you, <b>and</b> who sent you?” I asked.
<br>   “Saruman <b>the</b> White,” answered Radagast. “And he told me <b>to</b> say that if you feel <b>the</b> need, he will help; <b>but</b> you must seek his aid at once, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> will be too late."
<br>   “And that message brought me hope. For Saruman <b>the</b> White is <b>the</b> greatest <b>of</b> my order. Radagast is, <b>of</b> course, a worthy Wizard, a master <b>of</b> shapes <b>and</b> changes <b>of</b> hue; <b>and</b> he has much lore <b>of</b> herbs <b>and</b> beasts, <b>and</b> birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied <b>the</b> arts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy himself, <b>and</b> thus we have often been able <b>to</b> forestall him. It was <b>by</b> <b>the</b> devices <b>of</b> Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back <b>the</b> Nine.
<br>   “I will go <b>to</b> Saruman,” I said.
<br>   “Then you must go now,” said Radagast; “for I have wasted time in looking for you, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> days are running short. I was told <b>to</b> find you before Midsummer, <b>and</b> that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot, you will hardly reach him before <b>the</b> Nine discover <b>the</b> land that they seek. I myself shall turn back at once.” And with that he mounted <b>and</b> would have ridden straight off.
<br>   “Stay a moment!” I said. “We shall need your help, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> all things that will give <b>it</b>. Send out messages <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> beasts <b>and</b> birds that are your friends. Tell them <b>to</b> bring news <b>of</b> anything that bears <b>on</b> this matter <b>to</b> Saruman <b>and</b> Gandalf. Let messages be sent <b>to</b> Orthanc."
<br>   “I will do that,” he said, <b>and</b> rode off as if <b>the</b> Nine were after him.
<br>   “I could not follow him then <b>and</b> there. I had ridden very far already that day, <b>and</b> I was as weary as my horse; <b>and</b> I needed <b>to</b> consider matters. I stayed <b>the</b> night in Bree, <b>and</b> decided that I had <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Never did I make a greater mistake!
<br>   “However, I wrote a message <b>to</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> trusted <b>to</b> my friend <b>the</b> innkeeper <b>to</b> send <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him. I rode away at dawn; <b>and</b> I came at long last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dwelling <b>of</b> Saruman. That is far south in Isengard, in <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, not far from <b>the</b> Gap <b>of</b> Rohan. And Boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> northmost foothills <b>of</b> Ered Nimrais, <b>the</b> White Mountains <b>of</b> his home. But Isengard is a circle <b>of</b> sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> that valley is a tower <b>of</b> stone called Orthanc. It was not made <b>by</b> Saruman, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> N?menor long ago; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is very tall <b>and</b> has many secrets; yet <b>it</b> looks not <b>to</b> be a work <b>of</b> craft. It cannot be reached save <b>by</b> passing <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Isengard; <b>and</b> in that circle there is only one gate.
<br>   “Late one evening I came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate, like a great arch in <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> rock; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was strongly guarded. But <b>the</b> keepers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> watch for me <b>and</b> told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under <b>the</b> arch, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gate closed silently behind me, <b>and</b> suddenly I was afraid, though I knew <b>no</b> reason for <b>it</b>.
<br>   “But I rode <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> Orthanc, <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stair <b>of</b> Saruman <b>and</b> there he met me <b>and</b> led me up <b>to</b> his high chamber. He wore a ring <b>on</b> his finger.
<br>   “So you have come, Gandalf,” he said <b>to</b> me gravely; <b>but</b> in his eyes there seemed <b>to</b> be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart.
<br>   “Yes, I have come,” I said. “I have come for your aid, Saruman <b>the</b> White.” And that title seemed <b>to</b> anger him.
<br>   “Have you indeed, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey!” he scoffed. “For aid? It has seldom been heard <b>of</b> that Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey sought for aid, one so cunning <b>and</b> so wise, wandering about <b>the</b> lands, <b>and</b> concerning himself in every business, whether <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> him <b>or</b> not."
<br>   “I looked at him <b>and</b> wondered. “But if I am not deceived,” said I, “things are now moving which will require <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> all our strength."
<br>   “That may be so,” he said, “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> thought is late in coming <b>to</b> you. How long. I wonder, have you concealed from me, <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council, a matter <b>of</b> greatest import? What brings you now from your lurking-place in <b>the</b> Shire? “
<br>   “The Nine have come forth again,” I answered. “They have crossed <b>the</b> River. So Radagast said <b>to</b> me."
<br>   “Radagast <b>the</b> Brown!” laughed Saruman, <b>and</b> he <b>no</b> longer concealed his scorn. “Radagast <b>the</b> Bird-tamer! Radagast <b>the</b> Simple! Radagast <b>the</b> Fool! Yet he had just <b>the</b> wit <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> part that I set him. For you have come, <b>and</b> that was all <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey, <b>and</b> rest from journeys. For I am Saruman <b>the</b> Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman <b>of</b> Many Colours! “
<br>   “I looked then <b>and</b> saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, <b>but</b> were woven <b>of</b> all colours. <b>and</b> if he moved they shimmered <b>and</b> changed hue so that <b>the</b> eye was bewildered.
<br>   “I liked white better,” I said.
<br>   “White!” he sneered. “It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> white light can be broken."
<br>   “In which case <b>it</b> is <b>no</b> longer white,” said I. “And he that breaks a thing <b>to</b> find out what <b>it</b> is has left <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> wisdom."
<br>   “You need not speak <b>to</b> me as <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fools that you take for friends,” said he. “I have not brought you hither <b>to</b> be instructed <b>by</b> you, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> give you a choice."
<br>   “He drew himself up then <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> declaim, as if he were making a speech long rehearsed. “The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning. The time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves is over, <b>but</b> our time is at hand: <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> Men, which we must rule. But we must have power, power <b>to</b> order all things as we will, for that good which only <b>the</b> Wise can see.
<br>   “And listen, Gandalf, my old friend <b>and</b> helper!” he said, coming near <b>and</b> speaking now in a softer voice. “I said we, for we <b>it</b> may be, if you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against <b>it</b> <b>the</b> old allies <b>and</b> policies will not avail us at all. There is <b>no</b> hope left in Elves <b>or</b> dying N?menor. This then is one choice before you. before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; <b>and</b> there will be rich reward for those that aided <b>it</b>. As <b>the</b> Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wise, such as you <b>and</b> I, may with patience come at last <b>to</b> direct its courses, <b>to</b> control <b>it</b>. We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way, <b>but</b> approving <b>the</b> high <b>and</b> ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all <b>the</b> things that we have so far striven in vain <b>to</b> accomplish, hindered rather than helped <b>by</b> our weak <b>or</b> idle friends. There need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only in our means."
<br>   “Saruman,” I said, “I have heard speeches <b>of</b> this kind before, <b>but</b> only in <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> emissaries sent from Mordor <b>to</b> deceive <b>the</b> ignorant. I cannot think that you brought me so far only <b>to</b> weary my ears."
<br>   “He looked at me sidelong, <b>and</b> paused a while considering. “Well, I see that this wise course does not commend itself <b>to</b> you,” he said. “Not yet? Not if some better way can be contrived? “
<br>   “He came <b>and</b> laid his long hand <b>on</b> my arm. “And why not, Gandalf?” he whispered. “Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then <b>the</b> Power would pass <b>to</b> us. That is in truth why I brought you here. For I have many eyes in my service, <b>and</b> I believe that you know where this precious thing now lies. Is <b>it</b> not so? Or why do <b>the</b> Nine ask for <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> what is your business there?” As he said this a lust which he could not conceal shone suddenly in his eyes.
<br>   “Saruman,” I said, standing away from him, “only one hand at a time can wield <b>the</b> One, <b>and</b> you know that well, so do not trouble <b>to</b> say we! But I would not give <b>it</b>, nay, I would not give even news <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you, now that I learn your mind. You were head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council, <b>but</b> you have unmasked yourself at last. Well, <b>the</b> choices are, <b>it</b> seems, <b>to</b> submit <b>to</b> Sauron, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> yourself. I will take neither. Have you others <b>to</b> offer? “
<br>   “He was cold now <b>and</b> perilous. “Yes,” he said. “I did not expect you <b>to</b> show wisdom, even in your own behalf; <b>but</b> I gave you <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> aiding me willingly. <b>and</b> so saving yourself much trouble <b>and</b> pain. The third choice is <b>to</b> stay here, until <b>the</b> end."
<br>   “Until what end? “
<br>   “Until you reveal <b>to</b> me where <b>the</b> One may be found. I may find means <b>to</b> persuade you. Or until <b>it</b> is found in your despite, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ruler has time <b>to</b> turn <b>to</b> lighter matters: <b>to</b> devise, say, a fitting reward for <b>the</b> hindrance <b>and</b> insolence <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey."
<br>   “That may not prove <b>to</b> be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighter matters,” said I. He laughed at me, for my words were empty, <b>and</b> he knew <b>it</b>.
<br>   “They took me <b>and</b> they set me alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pinnacle <b>of</b> Orthanc, in <b>the</b> place where Saruman was accustomed <b>to</b> watch <b>the</b> stars. There is <b>no</b> descent save <b>by</b> a narrow stair <b>of</b> many thousand steps, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> valley below seems far away. I looked <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> saw that, whereas <b>it</b> had once been green <b>and</b> fair, <b>it</b> was now filled with pits <b>and</b> forges. Wolves <b>and</b> orcs were housed in Isengard, for Saruman was mustering a great force <b>on</b> his own account, in rivalry <b>of</b> Sauron <b>and</b> not in his service yet. Over all his works a dark smoke hung <b>and</b> wrapped itself about <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> Orthanc. I stood alone <b>on</b> an island in <b>the</b> clouds; <b>and</b> I had <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> escape, <b>and</b> my days were bitter. I was pierced with cold, <b>and</b> I had <b>but</b> little room in which <b>to</b> pace <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro, brooding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North.
<br>   “That <b>the</b> Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came <b>to</b> Isengard I had heard tidings <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for my friends in <b>the</b> Shire; <b>but</b> still I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once, as my letter had urged, <b>and</b> that he had reached Rivendell before <b>the</b> deadly pursuit began. And both my fear <b>and</b> my hope proved ill-founded. For my hope was founded <b>on</b> a fat man in Bree; <b>and</b> my fear was founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cunning <b>of</b> Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls <b>to</b> answer; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Sauron is still less than fear makes <b>it</b>. But in <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Isengard, trapped <b>and</b> alone, <b>it</b> was not easy <b>to</b> think that <b>the</b> hunters before whom all have fled <b>or</b> fallen would falter in <b>the</b> Shire far away.”
<br>   “I saw you!” cried Frodo. “You were walking backwards <b>and</b> forwards. The moon shone in your hair.”
<br>   Gandalf paused astonished <b>and</b> looked at him. “It was only a dream” said Frodo, “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> suddenly came back <b>to</b> me. I had quite forgotten <b>it</b>. It came some time ago; after I left <b>the</b> Shire, I think.”
<br>   “Then <b>it</b> was late in coming,” said Gandalf, “as you will see. I was in an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need, <b>and</b> do not bear such misfortune well. Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web! Yet even <b>the</b> most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread.
<br>   “At first I feared, as Saruman <b>no</b> doubt intended, that Radagast had also fallen. Yet I had caught <b>no</b> hint <b>of</b> anything wrong in his voice <b>or</b> in his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone <b>to</b> Isengard, <b>or</b> I should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, <b>and</b> he had concealed his mind <b>and</b> deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> win over <b>the</b> honest Radagast <b>to</b> treachery. He sought me in good faith, <b>and</b> so persuaded me.
<br>   “That was <b>the</b> undoing <b>of</b> Saruman's plot. For Radagast knew <b>no</b> reason why he should not do as I asked; <b>and</b> he rode away towards Mirkwood where he had many friends <b>of</b> old. And <b>the</b> Eagles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains went far <b>and</b> wide, <b>and</b> they saw many things: <b>the</b> gathering <b>of</b> wolves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mustering <b>of</b> Orcs; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nine Riders going hither <b>and</b> thither in <b>the</b> lands; <b>and</b> they heard news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escape <b>of</b> Gollum. And they sent a messenger <b>to</b> bring these tidings <b>to</b> me.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> was that when summer waned, there came a night <b>of</b> moon, <b>and</b> Gwaihir <b>the</b> Windlord, swiftest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Eagles, came unlooked-for <b>to</b> Orthanc; <b>and</b> he found me standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pinnacle. Then I spoke <b>to</b> him <b>and</b> he bore me away, before Saruman was aware. I was far from Isengard, ere <b>the</b> wolves <b>and</b> orcs issued from <b>the</b> gate <b>to</b> pursue me.
<br>   “How far can you bear me?” I said <b>to</b> Gwaihir.
<br>   “Many leagues,” said he, “<b>but</b> not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. I was sent <b>to</b> bear tidings not burdens."
<br>   “Then I must have a steed <b>on</b> land,” I said, “<b>and</b> a steed surpassingly swift, for I have never had such need <b>of</b> haste before."
<br>   “Then I will bear you <b>to</b> Edoras, where <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> Rohan sits in his halls,” he said; “for that is not very far off.” And I was glad, for in <b>the</b> Riddermark <b>of</b> Rohan <b>the</b> Rohirrim, <b>the</b> Horse-lords, dwell, <b>and</b> there are <b>no</b> horses like those that are bred in that great vale between <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White.
<br>   “Are <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Rohan still <b>to</b> be trusted, do you think?” I said <b>to</b> Gwaihir, for <b>the</b> treason <b>of</b> Saruman had shaken my faith.
<br>   “They pay a tribute <b>of</b> horses,” he answered, “<b>and</b> send many yearly <b>to</b> Mordor, <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> is said; <b>but</b> they are not yet under <b>the</b> yoke. But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long delayed."
<br>   “He set me down in <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Rohan ere dawn; <b>and</b> now I have lengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found evil already at work: <b>the</b> lies <b>of</b> Saruman; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> king <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land would not listen <b>to</b> my warnings. He bade me take a horse <b>and</b> be gone; <b>and</b> I chose one much <b>to</b> my liking. <b>but</b> little <b>to</b> his. I took <b>the</b> best horse in his land, <b>and</b> I have never seen <b>the</b> like <b>of</b> him.”
<br>   “Then he must be a noble beast indeed,” said Aragorn; “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> grieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse <b>to</b> learn that Sauron levies such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.”
<br>   “Nor is <b>it</b> now, I will swear,” said Boromir. “It is a lie that comes from <b>the</b> Enemy. I know <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Rohan; true <b>and</b> valiant, our allies, dwelling still in <b>the</b> lands that we gave them long ago.”
<br>   “The shadow <b>of</b> Mordor lies <b>on</b> distant lands,” answered Aragorn. “Saruman has fallen under <b>it</b>. Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find there, if ever you return?”
<br>   “Not this at least.” said Boromir, “that they will buy their lives with horses. They love their horses next <b>to</b> their kin. And not without reason, for <b>the</b> horses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riddermark come from <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, far from <b>the</b> Shadow. <b>and</b> their race, as that <b>of</b> their masters, is descended from <b>the</b> free days <b>of</b> old.”
<br>   “True indeed!” said Gandalf. “And there is one among them that might have been foaled in <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. The horses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nine cannot vie with him; tireless, swift as <b>the</b> flowing wind. Shadowfax they called him. By day his coat glistens like silver; <b>and</b> <b>by</b> night <b>it</b> is like a shade, <b>and</b> he passes unseen. Light is his footfall! Never before had any man mounted him, <b>but</b> I took him <b>and</b> I tamed him, <b>and</b> so speedily he bore me that I reached <b>the</b> Shire when Frodo was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs, though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.
<br>   “But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders, <b>and</b> though I gained <b>on</b> them day <b>by</b> day, they were ever before me. They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern borders, not far from <b>the</b> Greenway. <b>and</b> some invaded <b>the</b> Shire from <b>the</b> south. I came <b>to</b> Hobbiton <b>and</b> Frodo had gone; <b>but</b> I had words with old Gamgee. Many words <b>and</b> few <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point. He had much <b>to</b> say about <b>the</b> shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new owners <b>of</b> Bag End.
<br>   “I can't abide changes,” said he, “not at my time <b>of</b> life, <b>and</b> least <b>of</b> all changes for <b>the</b> worst.” “Changes for <b>the</b> worst,” he repeated many times.
<br>   “Worst is a bad word,” I said <b>to</b> him, “<b>and</b> I hope you do not live <b>to</b> see <b>it</b>.” But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before, <b>and</b> that a black horseman had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hill <b>the</b> same evening. Then I rode <b>on</b> in fear. I came <b>to</b> Buckland <b>and</b> found <b>it</b> in uproar, as busy as a hive <b>of</b> ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house at Crickhollow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was broken open <b>and</b> empty; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo's. Then for a while hope left me, <b>and</b> I did not wait <b>to</b> gather news, <b>or</b> I might have been comforted; <b>but</b> I rode <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders. It was hard <b>to</b> follow, for <b>it</b> went many ways, <b>and</b> I was at a loss. But <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me that one <b>or</b> two had ridden towards Bree; <b>and</b> that way I went, for I thought <b>of</b> words that might be said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> innkeeper.
<br>   “Butterbur they call him,” thought I. “If this delay was his fault, I will melt all <b>the</b> butter in him. I will roast <b>the</b> old fool over a slow fire.” He expected <b>no</b> less, <b>and</b> when he saw my face he fell down flat <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> melt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot.”
<br>   “What did you do <b>to</b> him?” cried Frodo in alarm. “He was really very kind <b>to</b> us <b>and</b> did all that he could.”
<br>   Gandalf laughed. “Don't be afraid!” he said. “I did not bite, <b>and</b> I barked very little. So overjoyed was I <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news that I got out <b>of</b> him, when he stopped quaking, that I embraced <b>the</b> old fellow. How <b>it</b> happened I could not then guess, <b>but</b> I learned that you had been in Bree <b>the</b> night before, <b>and</b> had gone off that morning with Strider.
<br>   “Strider!” I cried, shouting for joy.
<br>   “Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir,” said Butterbur, mistaking me. “He got at them, in spite <b>of</b> all that I could do, <b>and</b> they took up with him. They behaved very queer all <b>the</b> time they were here: wilful, you might say."
<br>   “Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy <b>and</b> beloved Barliman!” said I. “It's <b>the</b> best news I have had since midsummer: <b>it</b>'s worth a gold piece at <b>the</b> least. May your beer be laid under an enchantment <b>of</b> surpassing excellence for seven years!” said I. “Now I can take a night's rest, <b>the</b> first since I have forgotten when."
<br>   “So I stayed there that night, wondering much what had become <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders; for only <b>of</b> two had there yet been any news in Bree, <b>it</b> seemed. But in <b>the</b> night we heard more. Five at least came from <b>the</b> west, <b>and</b> they threw down <b>the</b> gates <b>and</b> passed through Bree like a howling wind; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk are still shivering <b>and</b> expecting <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. I got up before dawn <b>and</b> went after them.
<br>   “I do not know, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems clear <b>to</b> me that this is what happened. Their Captain remained in secret away south <b>of</b> Bree, while two rode ahead through <b>the</b> village, <b>and</b> four more invaded <b>the</b> Shire. But when these were foiled in Bree <b>and</b> at Crickhollow, they returned <b>to</b> their Captain with tidings, <b>and</b> so left <b>the</b> Road unguarded for a while, except <b>by</b> their spies. The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, <b>and</b> he himself with <b>the</b> rest rode along <b>the</b> Road in great wrath.
<br>   “I galloped <b>to</b> Weathertop like a gale, <b>and</b> I reached <b>it</b> before sundown <b>on</b> my second day from Bree-<b>and</b> they were there before me. They drew away from me, for they felt <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> my anger <b>and</b> they dared not face <b>it</b> while <b>the</b> Sun was in <b>the</b> sky. But they closed round at night, <b>and</b> I was besieged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top, in <b>the</b> old ring <b>of</b> Amon S?l. I was hard put <b>to</b> <b>it</b> indeed: such light <b>and</b> flame cannot have been seen <b>on</b> Weathertop since <b>the</b> war-beacons <b>of</b> old.
<br>   “At sunrise I escaped <b>and</b> fled towards <b>the</b> north. I could not hope <b>to</b> do more. It was impossible <b>to</b> find you, Frodo, in <b>the</b> wilderness, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would have been folly <b>to</b> try with all <b>the</b> Nine at my heels. So I had <b>to</b> trust <b>to</b> Aragorn. But I hoped <b>to</b> draw some <b>of</b> them off, <b>and</b> yet reach Rivendell ahead <b>of</b> you <b>and</b> send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, <b>but</b> they turned back after a while <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> Ford, <b>it</b> seems. That helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was attacked.
<br>   “I reached here at last <b>by</b> a long hard road, up <b>the</b> Hoarwell <b>and</b> through <b>the</b> Ettenmoors, <b>and</b> down from <b>the</b> north. It took me nearly fourteen days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among <b>the</b> rocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troll-fells, <b>and</b> Shadowfax departed. I sent him back <b>to</b> his master; <b>but</b> a great friendship has grown between us, <b>and</b> if I have need he will come at my call. But so <b>it</b> was that I came <b>to</b> Rivendell only three days before <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> news <b>of</b> its peril had already been brought here-which proved well indeed.
<br>   “And that, Frodo, is <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> my account. May Elrond <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others forgive <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst <b>and</b> did not come when he promised. An account <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ring-bearer <b>of</b> so strange an event was required, I think.
<br>   “Well, <b>the</b> Tale is now told, from first <b>to</b> last. Here we all are, <b>and</b> here is <b>the</b> Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer <b>to</b> our purpose. What shall we do with <b>it</b>?”
<br>   There was silence. At last Elrond spoke again.
<br>   “This is grievous news concerning Saruman,” he said; “for we trusted him <b>and</b> he is deep in all our counsels. It is perilous <b>to</b> study too deeply <b>the</b> arts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy, for good <b>or</b> for ill. But such falls <b>and</b> betrayals, alas, have happened before. Of <b>the</b> tales that we have heard this day <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Frodo was most strange <b>to</b> me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> me that he is perhaps not so alone <b>and</b> singular as I had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> westward roads.
<br>   “The Barrow-wights we know <b>by</b> many names; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest many tales have been told: all that now remains is <b>but</b> an outlier <b>of</b> its northern march. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree <b>to</b> tree from what is now <b>the</b> Shire <b>to</b> Dunland west <b>of</b> Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, <b>and</b> many things wild <b>and</b> strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this is still <b>the</b> same that walked <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> hills long ago, <b>and</b> even then was older than <b>the</b> old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest <b>and</b> fatherless. But many another name he has since been given <b>by</b> other folk: Forn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves, Orald <b>by</b> Northern Men, <b>and</b> other names beside. He is a strange creature, <b>but</b> maybe I should have summoned him <b>to</b> our Council.”
<br>   “He would not have come,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Could we not still send messages <b>to</b> him <b>and</b> obtain his help?” asked Erestor. “It seems that he has a power even over <b>the</b> Ring.”
<br>   “No, I should not put <b>it</b> so,” said Gandalf. “Say rather that <b>the</b> Ring has <b>no</b> power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter <b>the</b> Ring itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is withdrawn <b>into</b> a little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, waiting perhaps for a change <b>of</b> days, <b>and</b> he will not step beyond them.”
<br>   “But within those bounds nothing seems <b>to</b> dismay him,” said Erestor. “Would he not take <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> keep <b>it</b> there, for ever harmless?”
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf, “not willingly. He might do so, if all <b>the</b> free folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world begged him, <b>but</b> he would not understand <b>the</b> need. And if he were given <b>the</b> Ring, he would soon forget <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> most likely throw <b>it</b> away. Such things have <b>no</b> hold <b>on</b> his mind. He would be a most unsafe guardian; <b>and</b> that alone is answer enough.”
<br>   “But in any case,” said Glorfindel, “<b>to</b> send <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> him would only postpone <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> evil. He is far away. We could not now take <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> him, unguessed, unmarked <b>by</b> any spy. And even if we could, soon <b>or</b> late <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings would learn <b>of</b> its hiding place <b>and</b> would bend all his power towards <b>it</b>. Could that power be defied <b>by</b> Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in <b>the</b> end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First; <b>and</b> then Night will come.”
<br>   “I know little <b>of</b> Iarwain save <b>the</b> name,” said Galdor; “<b>but</b> Glorfindel, I think, is right. Power <b>to</b> defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power is in <b>the</b> earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture <b>and</b> destroy <b>the</b> very hills. What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, <b>or</b> with Cirdan at <b>the</b> Havens, <b>or</b> in L?rien. But have they <b>the</b> strength, have we here <b>the</b> strength <b>to</b> withstand <b>the</b> Enemy, <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> Sauron at <b>the</b> last, when all else is overthrown?”
<br>   “I have not <b>the</b> strength,” said Elrond; “neither have they.”
<br>   “Then if <b>the</b> Ring cannot be kept from him for ever <b>by</b> strength” said Glorfindel, “two things only remain for us <b>to</b> attempt: <b>to</b> send <b>it</b> over <b>the</b> Sea, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “But Gandalf has revealed <b>to</b> us that we cannot destroy <b>it</b> <b>by</b> any craft that we here possess,” said Elrond. “And they who dwell beyond <b>the</b> Sea would not receive <b>it</b>: for good <b>or</b> ill <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> Middle-earth; <b>it</b> is for us who still dwell here <b>to</b> deal with <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Then, said Glorfindel, “let us cast <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deeps, <b>and</b> so make <b>the</b> lies <b>of</b> Saruman come true. For <b>it</b> is clear now that even at <b>the</b> Council his feet were already <b>on</b> a crooked path. He knew that <b>the</b> Ring was not lost for ever, <b>but</b> wished us <b>to</b> think so; for he began <b>to</b> lust for <b>it</b> for himself. Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in <b>the</b> Sea <b>it</b> would be safe.”
<br>   “Not safe for ever,” said Gandalf. “There are many things in <b>the</b> deep waters; <b>and</b> seas <b>and</b> lands may change. And <b>it</b> is not our part here <b>to</b> take thought only for a season, <b>or</b> for a few lives <b>of</b> Men, <b>or</b> for a passing age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. We should seek a final end <b>of</b> this menace, even if we do not hope <b>to</b> make one.”
<br>   “And that we shall not find <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea,” said Galdor. “If <b>the</b> return <b>to</b> Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> S‚a is now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The Nine have been unhorsed indeed <b>but</b> that is <b>but</b> a respite, ere they find new steeds <b>and</b> swifter. Only <b>the</b> waning might <b>of</b> Gondor stands now between him <b>and</b> a march in power along <b>the</b> coasts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North; <b>and</b> if he comes, assailing <b>the</b> White Towers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Havens, hereafter <b>the</b> Elves may have <b>no</b> escape from <b>the</b> lengthening shadows <b>of</b> Middle-earth.”
<br>   “Long yet will that march be delayed,” said Boromir. “Gondor wanes, you say. But Gondor stands, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> its strength is still very strong.”
<br>   “And yet its vigilance can <b>no</b> longer keep back <b>the</b> Nine,” said Galdor. “And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.”
<br>   “Then,” said Erestor, “there are <b>but</b> two courses, as Glorfindel already has declared: <b>to</b> hide <b>the</b> Ring for ever; <b>or</b> <b>to</b> unmake <b>it</b>. But both are beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?”
<br>   “None here can do so,” said Elrond gravely. “At least none can foretell what will come <b>to</b> pass, if we take this road <b>or</b> that. But <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> me now clear which is <b>the</b> road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest. Therefore <b>it</b> must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often <b>the</b> Elves have fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope, if hope <b>it</b> be. To walk <b>into</b> peril-<b>to</b> Mordor. We must send <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fire.”
<br>   Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> clear waters, felt a dead darkness in his heart. Boromir stirred, <b>and</b> Frodo looked at him. He was fingering his great horn <b>and</b> frowning. At length he spoke.
<br>   “I do not understand all this,” he said. “Saruman is a traitor, <b>but</b> did he not have a glimpse <b>of</b> wisdom? Why do you speak ever <b>of</b> hiding <b>and</b> destroying? Why should we not think that <b>the</b> Great Ring has come <b>into</b> our hands <b>to</b> serve us in <b>the</b> very hour <b>of</b> need? Wielding <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Free Lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Free may surely defeat <b>the</b> Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem.
<br>   “The Men <b>of</b> Gondor are valiant, <b>and</b> they will never submit; <b>but</b> they may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, <b>and</b> then a weapon. Let <b>the</b> Ring be your weapon, if <b>it</b> has such power as you say. Take <b>it</b> <b>and</b> go forth <b>to</b> victory!”
<br>   “Alas, <b>no</b>,” said Elrond. “We cannot use <b>the</b> Ruling Ring. That we now know too well. It belongs <b>to</b> Sauron <b>and</b> was made <b>by</b> him alone, <b>and</b> is altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone <b>to</b> wield at will, save only those who have already a great power <b>of</b> their own. But for them <b>it</b> holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire <b>of</b> <b>it</b> corrupts <b>the</b> heart. Consider Saruman. If any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise should with this Ring overthrow <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself <b>on</b> Sauron's throne, <b>and</b> yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why <b>the</b> Ring should be destroyed: as long as <b>it</b> is in <b>the</b> world <b>it</b> will be a danger even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wise. For nothing is evil in <b>the</b> beginning. Even Sauron was not so. I fear <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> hide <b>it</b>. I will not take <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> wield <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Nor I,” said Gandalf.
<br>   Boromir looked at them doubtfully, <b>but</b> he bowed his head. “So be <b>it</b>,” he said. “Then in Gondor we must trust <b>to</b> such weapons as we have. And at <b>the</b> least, while <b>the</b> Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight <b>on</b>. Mayhap <b>the</b> Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem <b>the</b> tide—if <b>the</b> hand that wields <b>it</b> has inherited not an heirloom only, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sinews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> Men.”
<br>   “Who can tell?” said Aragorn. “But we will put <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test one day.”
<br>   “May <b>the</b> day not be too long delayed,” said Boromir. “For though I do not ask for aid, we need <b>it</b>. It would comfort us <b>to</b> know that others fought also with all <b>the</b> means that they have.”
<br>   “Then be comforted,” said Elrond. “For there are other powers <b>and</b> realms that you know not, <b>and</b> they are hidden from you. Anduin <b>the</b> Great flows past many shores, ere <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> Argonath <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gates <b>of</b> Gondor.”
<br>   “Still <b>it</b> might be well for all,” said Gl?in <b>the</b> Dwarf, “if all these strengths were joined, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> powers <b>of</b> each were used in league. Other rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The Seven are lost <b>to</b> us—if Balin has not found <b>the</b> ring <b>of</b> Thr?r which was <b>the</b> last; naught has been heard <b>of</b> <b>it</b> since Thr?r perished in Moria. Indeed I may now reveal that <b>it</b> was partly in hope <b>to</b> find that ring that Balin went away.”
<br>   “Balin will find <b>no</b> ring in Moria,” said Gandalf. “Thr?r gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Thr?in his son, <b>but</b> not Thr?in <b>to</b> Thorin. It was taken with torment from Thr?in in <b>the</b> dungeons <b>of</b> Dol Guldur. I came too late.”
<br>   “Ah, alas!” cried Gl?in. “When will <b>the</b> day come <b>of</b> our revenge? But still there are <b>the</b> Three. What <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Rings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves? Very mighty Rings, <b>it</b> is said. Do not <b>the</b> Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not say?”
<br>   The Elves returned <b>no</b> answer. “Did you not hear me, Gl?in?” said Elrond. “The Three were not made <b>by</b> Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But <b>of</b> them <b>it</b> is not permitted <b>to</b> speak. So much only in this hour <b>of</b> doubt I may now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapons <b>of</b> war <b>or</b> conquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire strength <b>or</b> domination <b>or</b> hoarded wealth, <b>but</b> understanding, making, <b>and</b> healing, <b>to</b> preserve all things unstained. These things <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that has been wrought <b>by</b> those who wield <b>the</b> Three will turn <b>to</b> their undoing, <b>and</b> their minds <b>and</b> hearts will become revealed <b>to</b> Sauron, if he regains <b>the</b> One. It would be better if <b>the</b> Three had never been. That is his purpose.”
<br>   “But what then would happen, if <b>the</b> Ruling Ring were destroyed as you counsel?” asked Gl?in.
<br>   “We know not for certain,” answered Elrond sadly. “Some hope that <b>the</b> Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then become free, <b>and</b> their rulers might heal <b>the</b> hurts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world that he has wrought. But maybe when <b>the</b> One has gone, <b>the</b> Three will fail, <b>and</b> many fair things will fade <b>and</b> be forgotten. That is my belief.”
<br>   “Yet all <b>the</b> Elves are willing <b>to</b> endure this chance,” said Glorfindel “if <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Sauron may be broken, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> his dominion be taken away for ever.”
<br>   “Thus we return once more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destroying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring,” said Erestor, “<b>and</b> yet we come <b>no</b> nearer. What strength have we for <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fire in which <b>it</b> was made? That is <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> despair. Of folly I would say, if <b>the</b> long wisdom <b>of</b> Elrond did not forbid me.”
<br>   “Despair, <b>or</b> folly?” said Gandalf. “It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see <b>the</b> end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom <b>to</b> recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly <b>it</b> may appear <b>to</b> those who cling <b>to</b> false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy! For he is very wise, <b>and</b> weighs all things <b>to</b> a nicety in <b>the</b> scales <b>of</b> his malice. But <b>the</b> only measure that he knows is desire, desire for power; <b>and</b> so he judges all hearts. Into his heart <b>the</b> thought will not enter that any will refuse <b>it</b>, that having <b>the</b> Ring we may seek <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>. If we seek this, we shall put him out <b>of</b> reckoning.”
<br>   “At least for a while,” said Elrond. “The road must be trod, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon <b>it</b>. This quest may be attempted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weak with as much hope as <b>the</b> strong. Yet such is oft <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> deeds that move <b>the</b> wheels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world: small hands do them because they must, while <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great are elsewhere.”
<br>   “Very well, very well, Master Elrond!” said Bilbo suddenly. “Say <b>no</b> more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo <b>the</b> silly hobbit started this affair, <b>and</b> Bilbo had better finish <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> himself. I was very comfortable here, <b>and</b> getting <b>on</b> with my book. If you want <b>to</b> know, I am just writing an ending for <b>it</b>. I had thought <b>of</b> putting: <b>and</b> he lived happily ever afterwards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his days. It is a good ending, <b>and</b> none <b>the</b> worse for having been used before. Now I shall have <b>to</b> alter that: <b>it</b> does not look like coming true; <b>and</b> anyway there will evidently have <b>to</b> be several more chapters, if I live <b>to</b> write them. It is a frightful nuisance. When ought I <b>to</b> start?
<br>   “Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> laughter died <b>on</b> his lips when he saw that all <b>the</b> others regarded <b>the</b> old hobbit with grave respect. Only Gl?in smiled, <b>but</b> his smile came from old memories.
<br>   “Of course, my dear Bilbo,” said Gandalf. “If you had really started this affair, you might be expected <b>to</b> finish <b>it</b>. But you know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any, <b>and</b> that only a small part is played in great deeds <b>by</b> any hero. You need not bow! Though <b>the</b> word was meant, <b>and</b> we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has passed <b>on</b>. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> ending unaltered! There is still hope for <b>it</b>. But get ready <b>to</b> write a sequel, when they come back.”
<br>   Bilbo laughed. “I have never known you give me pleasant advice before.” he said. “As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this advice is not bad. Still, I don't suppose I have <b>the</b> strength <b>or</b> luck left <b>to</b> deal with <b>the</b> Ring. It has grown, <b>and</b> I have not. But tell me: what do you mean <b>by</b> they?”
<br>   “The messengers who are sent with <b>the</b> Ring.”
<br>   “Exactly! And who are they <b>to</b> be? That seems <b>to</b> me what this Council has <b>to</b> decide, <b>and</b> all that <b>it</b> has <b>to</b> decide. Elves may thrive <b>on</b> speech alone, <b>and</b> Dwarves endure great weariness; <b>but</b> I am only an old hobbit, <b>and</b> I miss my meal at noon. Can't you think <b>of</b> some names now? Or put <b>it</b> off till after dinner?”
<br>   No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still <b>no</b> one spoke. Frodo glanced at all <b>the</b> faces, <b>but</b> they were not turned <b>to</b> him. All <b>the</b> Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell <b>on</b> him, as if he was awaiting <b>the</b> pronouncement <b>of</b> some doom that he had long foreseen <b>and</b> vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing <b>to</b> rest <b>and</b> remain at peace <b>by</b> Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, <b>and</b> wondered <b>to</b> hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice.
<br>   “I will take <b>the</b> Ring,” he said, “though I do not know <b>the</b> way.”
<br>   Elrond raised his eyes <b>and</b> looked at him, <b>and</b> Frodo felt his heart pierced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden keenness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glance. “If I understand aright all that I have heard,” he said, “I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo; <b>and</b> that if you do not find a way, <b>no</b> one will. This is <b>the</b> hour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields <b>to</b> shake <b>the</b> towers <b>and</b> counsels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great. Who <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> Wise could have foreseen <b>it</b>? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect <b>to</b> know <b>it</b>, until <b>the</b> hour has struck?
<br>   “But <b>it</b> is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay <b>it</b> <b>on</b> another. I do not lay <b>it</b> <b>on</b> you. But if you take <b>it</b> freely, I will say that your choice is right; <b>and</b> though all <b>the</b> mighty elf-friends <b>of</b> old, Hador, <b>and</b> H?rin, <b>and</b> T?rin, <b>and</b> Beren himself were assembled together your seat should be among them.”
<br>   “But you won't send him off alone surely, Master?” cried Sam, unable <b>to</b> contain himself any longer, <b>and</b> jumping up from <b>the</b> corner where he had been quietly sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.
<br>   “No indeed!” said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. “You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible <b>to</b> separate you from him, even when he is summoned <b>to</b> a secret council <b>and</b> you are not.”
<br>   Sam sat down, blushing <b>and</b> muttering. “A nice pickle we have landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!” he said, shaking his head.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>THE RING GOES SOUTH
<br>
<br>   Later that day <b>the</b> hobbits held a meeting <b>of</b> their own in Bilbo's room. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Council, <b>and</b> had been chosen as Frodo's companion.
<br>   “It's most unfair,” said Pippin. “Instead <b>of</b> throwing him out, <b>and</b> clapping him in chains, Elrond goes <b>and</b> rewards him for his cheek!”
<br>   “Rewards!” said Frodo. “I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You are not thinking what you are saying: condemned <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> this hopeless journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, <b>and</b> I could rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.”
<br>   “I don't wonder,” said Merry, “<b>and</b> I wish you could. But we are envying Sam, not you. If you have <b>to</b> go, then <b>it</b> will be a punishment for any <b>of</b> us <b>to</b> be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you <b>and</b> been through some stiff times. We want <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>.”
<br>   “That's what I meant,” said Pippin. “We hobbits ought <b>to</b> stick together, <b>and</b> we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be someone with intelligence in <b>the</b> party.”
<br>   “Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!” said Gandalf, looking in through <b>the</b> window, which was near <b>the</b> ground. “But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided yet.”
<br>   “Nothing decided!” cried Pippin. “Then what were you all doing? You were shut up for hours.”
<br>   "Talking,” said Bilbo. “There was a deal <b>of</b> talk, <b>and</b> everyone had an eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas's bit <b>of</b> news about Gollum caught even him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hop, though he passed <b>it</b> off.”
<br>   “You were wrong,” said Gandalf. “You were inattentive. I had already heard <b>of</b> <b>it</b> from Gwaihir. If you want <b>to</b> know, <b>the</b> only real eye-openers, as you put <b>it</b>, were you <b>and</b> Frodo; <b>and</b> I was <b>the</b> only one that was not surprised.”
<br>   “Well, anyway,” said Bilbo, “nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo <b>and</b> Sam. I was afraid all <b>the</b> time that <b>it</b> might come <b>to</b> that, if I was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when <b>the</b> reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?”
<br>   “Yes,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scouts have been sent out already. More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, <b>and</b> they will get in touch with <b>the</b> Rangers, <b>and</b> maybe with Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood. And Aragorn has gone with Elrond's sons. We shall have <b>to</b> scour <b>the</b> lands all round for many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will probably make quite a long stay here.”
<br>   “Ah!” said Sam gloomily. “We'll just wait long enough for winter <b>to</b> come.”
<br>   “That can't be helped,” said Bilbo. “It's your fault partly, Frodo my lad: insisting <b>on</b> waiting for my birthday. A funny way <b>of</b> honouring <b>it</b>, I can't help thinking. Not <b>the</b> day I should have chosen for letting <b>the</b> S.-B.s <b>into</b> Bag End. But there <b>it</b> is: you can't wait now fill spring; <b>and</b> you can't go till <b>the</b> reports come back.
<br>   
<br>When winter first begins <b>to</b> bite
<br><b>and</b> stones crack in <b>the</b> frosty night,
<br>when pools are black <b>and</b> trees are bare,
<br>'tis evil in <b>the</b> Wild <b>to</b> fare.
<br>   
<br>   But that I am afraid will be just your luck.”
<br>   “I am afraid <b>it</b> will,” said Gandalf. “We can't start until we have found out about <b>the</b> Riders.”
<br>   “I thought they were all destroyed in <b>the</b> flood,” said Merry.
<br>   “You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,” said Gandalf. “The power <b>of</b> their master is in them, <b>and</b> they stand <b>or</b> fall <b>by</b> him. We hope that they were all unhorsed <b>and</b> unmasked, <b>and</b> so made for a while less dangerous; <b>but</b> we must find out for certain. In <b>the</b> meantime you should try <b>and</b> forget your troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything <b>to</b> help you; <b>but</b> I will whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in <b>the</b> party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.”
<br>   So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left <b>the</b> window-sill, where he had been sitting, <b>and</b> took off his hat <b>and</b> bowed. “I only said I think I shall come. Do not count <b>on</b> anything yet. In this matter Elrond will have much <b>to</b> say, <b>and</b> your friend <b>the</b> Strider. Which reminds me, I want <b>to</b> see Elrond. I must be off.”
<br>   “How long do you think I shall have here?” said Frodo <b>to</b> Bilbo when Gandalf had gone.
<br>   “Oh, I don't know. I can't count days in Rivendell,” said Bilbo. “But quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping me with my book, <b>and</b> making a start <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next? Have you thought <b>of</b> an ending?”
<br>   “Yes, several, <b>and</b> all are dark <b>and</b> unpleasant,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Oh, that won't do!” said Bilbo. “Books ought <b>to</b> have good endings. How would this do: <b>and</b> they all settled down <b>and</b> lived together happily ever after?”
<br>   “It will do well, if <b>it</b> ever comes <b>to</b> that,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Ah!” said Sam. “And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.”
<br>   For a while <b>the</b> hobbits continued <b>to</b> talk <b>and</b> think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past journey <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perils that lay ahead; <b>but</b> such was <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Rivendell that soon all fear <b>and</b> anxiety was lifted from their minds. The future, good <b>or</b> ill, was not forgotten, <b>but</b> ceased <b>to</b> have any power over <b>the</b> present. Health <b>and</b> hope grew strong in them, <b>and</b> they were content with each good day as <b>it</b> came, taking pleasure in every meal, <b>and</b> in every word <b>and</b> song.
<br>   So <b>the</b> days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright <b>and</b> fair, <b>and</b> each evening followed cool <b>and</b> clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly <b>the</b> golden light faded <b>to</b> pale silver, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lingering leaves fell from <b>the</b> naked trees. A wind began <b>to</b> blow chill from <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in <b>the</b> night sky, <b>and</b> put <b>to</b> flight all <b>the</b> lesser stars. But low in <b>the</b> South one star shone red. Every night, as <b>the</b> Moon waned again, <b>it</b> shone brighter <b>and</b> brighter. Frodo could see <b>it</b> from his window, deep in <b>the</b> heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above <b>the</b> trees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley.
<br>   The hobbits had been nearly two months in <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>and</b> November had gone <b>by</b> with <b>the</b> last shreds <b>of</b> autumn, <b>and</b> December was passing, when <b>the</b> scouts began <b>to</b> return. Some had gone north beyond <b>the</b> springs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hoarwell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ettenmoors; <b>and</b> others had gone west, <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rangers had searched <b>the</b> lands far down <b>the</b> Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where <b>the</b> old North Road crossed <b>the</b> river <b>by</b> a ruined town. Many had gone east <b>and</b> south; <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> these had crossed <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed <b>the</b> pass at <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gladden River, <b>and</b> had come down <b>into</b> Wilderland <b>and</b> over <b>the</b> Gladden Fields <b>and</b> so at length had reached <b>the</b> old home <b>of</b> Radagast at Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; <b>and</b> they had returned over <b>the</b> high pass that was called <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair. The sons <b>of</b> Elrond, Elladan <b>and</b> Elrohir, were <b>the</b> last <b>to</b> return; they had made a great journey, passing down <b>the</b> Silverlode <b>into</b> a strange country, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> their errand they would not speak <b>to</b> any save <b>to</b> Elrond.
<br>   In <b>no</b> region had <b>the</b> messengers discovered any signs <b>or</b> tidings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders <b>or</b> other servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Even from <b>the</b> Eagles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains they had learned <b>no</b> fresh news. Nothing had been seen <b>or</b> heard <b>of</b> Gollum; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wild wolves were still gathering, <b>and</b> were hunting again far up <b>the</b> Great River. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black horses had been found at once drowned in <b>the</b> flooded Ford. On <b>the</b> rocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapids below <b>it</b> searchers discovered <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> five more, <b>and</b> also a long black cloak, slashed <b>and</b> tattered. Of <b>the</b> Black Riders <b>no</b> other trace was <b>to</b> be seen, <b>and</b> nowhere was their presence <b>to</b> be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from <b>the</b> North.
<br>   “Eight out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nine are accounted for at least,” said Gandalf. “It is rash <b>to</b> be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that <b>the</b> Ringwraiths were scattered, <b>and</b> have been obliged <b>to</b> return as best they could <b>to</b> their Master in Mordor, empty <b>and</b> shapeless.
<br>   “If that is so, <b>it</b> will be some time before they can begin <b>the</b> hunt again. Of course <b>the</b> Enemy has other servants, <b>but</b> they will have <b>to</b> journey all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. And if we are careful that will be hard <b>to</b> find. But we must delay <b>no</b> longer.”
<br>   Elrond summoned <b>the</b> hobbits <b>to</b> him. He looked gravely at Frodo. “The time has come,” he said. “If <b>the</b> Ring is <b>to</b> set out, <b>it</b> must go soon. But those who go with <b>it</b> must not count <b>on</b> their errand being aided <b>by</b> war <b>or</b> force. They must pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy far from aid. Do you still hold <b>to</b> your word, Frodo, that you will be <b>the</b> Ring-bearer?”
<br>   “I do,” said Frodo. “I will go with Sam.”
<br>   “Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,” said Elrond. “I can foresee very little <b>of</b> your road; <b>and</b> how your task is <b>to</b> be achieved I do not know. The Shadow has crept now <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> draws nigh even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Greyflood; <b>and</b> under <b>the</b> Shadow all is dark <b>to</b> me. You will meet many foes, some open, <b>and</b> some disguised; <b>and</b> you may find friends upon your way when you least look for <b>it</b>. I will send out messages, such as I can contrive, <b>to</b> those whom I know in <b>the</b> wide world; <b>but</b> so perilous are <b>the</b> lands now become that some may well miscarry, <b>or</b> come <b>no</b> quicker than you yourself.
<br>   “And I will choose you companions <b>to</b> go with you, as far as they will <b>or</b> fortune allows. The number must be few, since your hope is in speed <b>and</b> secrecy. Had I a host <b>of</b> Elves in armour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days, <b>it</b> would avail little, save <b>to</b> arouse <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   “The Company <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring shall be Nine; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nine Walkers shall be set against <b>the</b> Nine Riders that are evil. With you <b>and</b> your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, <b>and</b> maybe <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his labours.
<br>   “For <b>the</b> rest, they shall represent <b>the</b> other Free Peoples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World: Elves, Dwarves, <b>and</b> Men. Legolas shall be for <b>the</b> Elves; <b>and</b> Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?in for <b>the</b> Dwarves. They are willing <b>to</b> go at least <b>to</b> <b>the</b> passes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn, for <b>the</b> Ring <b>of</b> Isildur concerns him closely.”
<br>   “Strider!” said Frodo.
<br>   “Yes,” he said with a smile. “I ask leave once again <b>to</b> be your companion, Frodo.”
<br>   “I would have begged you <b>to</b> come,” said Frodo, “only I thought you were going <b>to</b> Minas Tirith with Boromir.”
<br>   “I am,” said Aragorn. “And <b>the</b> Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged ere I set out <b>to</b> war. But your road <b>and</b> our road lie together for many hundreds <b>of</b> miles. Therefore Boromir will also be in <b>the</b> Company. He is a valiant man.”
<br>   “There remain two more <b>to</b> be found,” said Elrond. “These I will consider. Of my household I may find some that <b>it</b> seems good <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> send.”
<br>   “But that will leave <b>no</b> place for us!” cried Pippin in dismay. “We don't want <b>to</b> be left behind. We want <b>to</b> go with Frodo.”
<br>   “That is because you do not understand <b>and</b> cannot imagine what lies ahead,” said Elrond.
<br>   “Neither does Frodo,” said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. “Nor do any <b>of</b> us see clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood <b>the</b> danger, they would not dare <b>to</b> go. But they would still wish <b>to</b> go, <b>or</b> wish that they dared, <b>and</b> be shamed <b>and</b> unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in this matter <b>it</b> would be well <b>to</b> trust rather <b>to</b> their friendship than <b>to</b> great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he could not storm <b>the</b> Dark Tower, nor open <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fire <b>by</b> <b>the</b> power that is in him.”
<br>   “You speak gravely,” said Elrond, “<b>but</b> I am in doubt. The Shire, I forebode, is not free now from peril; <b>and</b> these two I had thought <b>to</b> send back there as messengers, <b>to</b> do what they could, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fashion <b>of</b> their country, <b>to</b> warn <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> their danger. In any case, I judge that <b>the</b> younger <b>of</b> these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against his going.”
<br>   “Then, Master Elrond, you will have <b>to</b> lock me in prison, <b>or</b> send me home tied in a sack,” said Pippin. “For otherwise I shall follow <b>the</b> Company.”
<br>   “Let <b>it</b> be so then. You shall go,” said Elrond, <b>and</b> he sighed. “Now <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Nine is filled. In seven days <b>the</b> Company must depart.”
<br>   The Sword <b>of</b> Elendil was forged anew <b>by</b> Elvish smiths, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> its blade was traced a device <b>of</b> seven stars set between <b>the</b> crescent Moon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rayed Sun, <b>and</b> about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn was going <b>to</b> war upon <b>the</b> marches <b>of</b> Mordor. Very bright was that sword when <b>it</b> was made whole again; <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun shone redly in <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon shone cold, <b>and</b> its edge was hard <b>and</b> keen. And Aragorn gave <b>it</b> a new name <b>and</b> called <b>it</b> And?ril, Flame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West.
<br>   Aragorn <b>and</b> Gandalf walked together <b>or</b> sat speaking <b>of</b> their road <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perils they would meet; <b>and</b> they pondered <b>the</b> storied <b>and</b> figured maps <b>and</b> books <b>of</b> lore that were in <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with them; <b>but</b> he was content <b>to</b> lean <b>on</b> their guidance, <b>and</b> he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo.
<br>   In those last days <b>the</b> hobbits sat together in <b>the</b> evening in <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fire, <b>and</b> there among many tales they heard told in full <b>the</b> lay <b>of</b> Beren <b>and</b> L?thien <b>and</b> <b>the</b> winning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Jewel; <b>but</b> in <b>the</b> day, while Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were out <b>and</b> about, Frodo <b>and</b> Sam were <b>to</b> be found with Bilbo in his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which still seemed very incomplete). <b>or</b> scraps <b>of</b> his verses, <b>or</b> would take notes <b>of</b> Frodo's adventures.
<br>   On <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted <b>the</b> lid <b>and</b> fumbled inside.
<br>   “Here is your sword,” he said. “But <b>it</b> was broken, you know. I took <b>it</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b> safe <b>but</b> I've forgotten <b>to</b> ask if <b>the</b> smiths could mend <b>it</b>. No time now.. So I thought, perhaps, you would care <b>to</b> have this, don't you know?”
<br>   He took from <b>the</b> box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. Then he drew <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> its polished <b>and</b> well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold <b>and</b> bright. “This is Sting,” he said, <b>and</b> thrust <b>it</b> with little effort deep <b>into</b> a wooden beam. “Take <b>it</b>, if you like. I shan't want <b>it</b> again, I expect.”
<br>   Frodo accepted <b>it</b> gratefully.
<br>   “Also there is this!” said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed <b>to</b> be rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds <b>of</b> old cloth, <b>and</b> held up a small shirt <b>of</b> mail. It was close-woven <b>of</b> many rings, as supple almost as linen, cold as ice, <b>and</b> harder than steel. It shone like moonlit silver, <b>and</b> was studded with white gems. With <b>it</b> was a belt <b>of</b> pearl <b>and</b> crystal.
<br>   “It's a pretty thing, isn't <b>it</b>?” said Bilbo, moving <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> light. “And useful. It is my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me. I got <b>it</b> back from Michel Delving before I started, <b>and</b> packed <b>it</b> with my luggage: I brought all <b>the</b> mementoes <b>of</b> my Journey away with me, except <b>the</b> Ring. But I did not expect <b>to</b> use this, <b>and</b> I don't need <b>it</b> now, except <b>to</b> look at sometimes. You hardly feel any weight when you put <b>it</b> <b>on</b>.”
<br>   “I should look—well, I don't think I should look right in <b>it</b>,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Just what I said myself,” said Bilbo. “But never mind about looks. You can wear <b>it</b> under your outer clothes. Come <b>on</b>! You must share this secret with me. Don't tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you were wearing <b>it</b>. I have a fancy <b>it</b> would turn even <b>the</b> knives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders,” he ended in a low voice.
<br>   “Very well, I will take <b>it</b>,” said Frodo. Bilbo put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> him, <b>and</b> fastened Sting upon <b>the</b> glittering belt; <b>and</b> then Frodo put over <b>the</b> top his old weather-stained breeches, tunic, <b>and</b> jacket.
<br>   “Just a plain hobbit you look,” said Bilbo. “But there is more about you now than appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface. Good luck <b>to</b> you!” He turned away <b>and</b> looked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, trying <b>to</b> hum a tune.
<br>   “I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, <b>and</b> for all our past kindnesses,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Don't try!” said <b>the</b> old hobbit, turning round <b>and</b> slapping him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back. “Ow!” he cried. “You are too hard now <b>to</b> slap! But there you are: Hobbits must stick together, <b>and</b> especially Bagginses. All I ask in return is: take as much care <b>of</b> yourself as you can. <b>and</b> bring back all <b>the</b> news you can, <b>and</b> any old songs <b>and</b> tales you can come <b>by</b>. I'll do my best <b>to</b> finish my book before you return. I should like <b>to</b> write <b>the</b> second book, if I am spared.” He broke off <b>and</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window again, singing softly.
<br>   
<br>I sit beside <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> all that I have seen,
<br><b>of</b> meadow-flowers <b>and</b> butterflies
<br>in summers that have been;
<br>
<br>Of yellow leaves <b>and</b> gossamer
<br>in autumns that there were,
<br>with morning mist <b>and</b> silver sun
<br><b>and</b> wind upon my hair.
<br>
<br>I sit beside <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> how <b>the</b> world will be
<br>when winter comes without a spring
<br>that I shall ever see.
<br>
<br>For still there are so many things
<br>that I have never seen:
<br>in every wood in every spring
<br>there is a different green.
<br>
<br>I sit beside <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> people long ago,
<br><b>and</b> people who will see a world
<br>that I shall never know.
<br>
<br>But all <b>the</b> while I sit <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> times there were before,
<br>I listen for returning feet
<br><b>and</b> voices at <b>the</b> door.
<br>   
<br>   It was a cold grey day near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> December. The East Wind was streaming through <b>the</b> bare branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> seething in <b>the</b> dark pines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark <b>and</b> low. As <b>the</b> cheerless shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early evening began <b>to</b> fall <b>the</b> Company made ready <b>to</b> set out. They were <b>to</b> start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them <b>to</b> journey under cover <b>of</b> night as often as they could, until they were far from Rivendell.
<br>   “You should fear <b>the</b> many eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> Sauron,” he said. “I do not doubt that news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discomfiture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders has already reached him, <b>and</b> he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies <b>on</b> foot <b>and</b> wing will be abroad in <b>the</b> northern lands. Even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky above you must beware as you go <b>on</b> your way.”
<br>   The Company took little gear <b>of</b> war, for their hope was in secrecy not in battle. Aragorn had And?ril <b>but</b> <b>no</b> other weapon, <b>and</b> he went forth clad only in rusty green <b>and</b> brown. as a Ranger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. Boromir had a long sword, in fashion like And?ril <b>but</b> <b>of</b> less lineage <b>and</b> he bore also a shield <b>and</b> his war-horn.
<br>   “Loud <b>and</b> clear <b>it</b> sounds in <b>the</b> valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills,” he said, “<b>and</b> then let all <b>the</b> foes <b>of</b> Gondor flee!” Putting <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his lips he blew a blast, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> echoes leapt from rock <b>to</b> rock, <b>and</b> all that heard that voice in Rivendell sprang <b>to</b> their feet.
<br>   Slow should you be <b>to</b> wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond. “until you stand once more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> your land, <b>and</b> dire need is <b>on</b> you.”
<br>   “Maybe,” said Boromir. “But always I have let my horn cry at setting forth, <b>and</b> though thereafter we may walk in <b>the</b> shadows, I will not go forth as a thief in <b>the</b> night.”
<br>   Gimli <b>the</b> dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt <b>of</b> steel-rings, for dwarves make light <b>of</b> burdens; <b>and</b> in his belt was a broad-bladed axe. Legolas had a bow <b>and</b> a quiver, <b>and</b> at his belt a long white knife. The younger hobbits wore <b>the</b> swords that they had taken from <b>the</b> barrow; <b>but</b> Frodo took only Sting; <b>and</b> his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore his staff, <b>but</b> girt at his side was <b>the</b> elven-sword Glamdring, <b>the</b> mate <b>of</b> Orcrist that lay now upon <b>the</b> breast <b>of</b> Thorin under <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain.
<br>   All were well furnished <b>by</b> Elrond with thick warm clothes, <b>and</b> they had jackets <b>and</b> cloaks lined with fur. Spare food <b>and</b> clothes <b>and</b> blankets <b>and</b> other needs were laden <b>on</b> a pony, none other than <b>the</b> poor beast that they had brought from Bree.
<br>   ?he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder <b>of</b> change <b>on</b> him: he was glossy <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> vigour <b>of</b> youth. It was Sam who had insisted <b>on</b> choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine, if he did not come.
<br>   “That animal can nearly talk,” he said, “<b>and</b> would talk, if he stayed here much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak <b>it</b>: if you don't let me go with you, Sam, I'll follow <b>on</b> my own.” So Bill was going as <b>the</b> beast <b>of</b> burden, yet he was <b>the</b> only member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company that did not seem depressed.
<br>   Their farewells had been said in <b>the</b> great hall <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. A gleam <b>of</b> firelight came from <b>the</b> open doors, <b>and</b> soft lights were glowing in many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep beside Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed <b>to</b> his knees; only Elrond knew fully what this hour meant <b>to</b> him. The others could be seen as grey shapes in <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   Sam was standing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pony, sucking his teeth, <b>and</b> staring moodily <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom where <b>the</b> river roared stonily below; his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb.
<br>   “Bill, my lad,” he said, “you oughtn't <b>to</b> have took up with us. You could have stayed here <b>and</b> et <b>the</b> best hay till <b>the</b> new grass comes.” Bill swished his tail <b>and</b> said nothing.
<br>   Sam eased <b>the</b> pack <b>on</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> went over anxiously in his mind all <b>the</b> things that he had stowed in <b>it</b>, wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little box <b>of</b> salt that he always carried <b>and</b> refilled when he could; a good supply <b>of</b> pipe-weed (<b>but</b> not near enough, I'll warrant); flint <b>and</b> tinder; woollen hose: linen; various small belongings <b>of</b> his master's that Frodo had forgotten <b>and</b> Sam had stowed <b>to</b> bring them out in triumph when they were called for. He went through them all.
<br>   “Rope!” he muttered. “No rope! And only last night you said <b>to</b> yourself: “Sam, what about a bit <b>of</b> rope? You'll want <b>it</b>, if you haven't got <b>it</b>:” Well, I'll want <b>it</b>. I can't get <b>it</b> now.”
<br>   At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, <b>and</b> he called <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> him. “This is my last word,” he said in a low voice. “The Ring-bearer is setting out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Quest <b>of</b> Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid: neither <b>to</b> cast away <b>the</b> Ring, nor <b>to</b> deliver <b>it</b> <b>to</b> any servant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy nor indeed <b>to</b> let any handle <b>it</b>, save members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Council, <b>and</b> only then in gravest need. The others go with him as free companions, <b>to</b> help him <b>on</b> his way. You may tarry, <b>or</b> come back, <b>or</b> turn aside <b>into</b> other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, <b>the</b> less easy will <b>it</b> be <b>to</b> withdraw; yet <b>no</b> oath <b>or</b> bond is laid <b>on</b> you <b>to</b> go further than you will. For you do not yet know <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> your hearts, <b>and</b> you cannot foresee what each may meet upon <b>the</b> road.”
<br>   “Faithless is he that says farewell when <b>the</b> road darkens,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Maybe,” said Elrond, “<b>but</b> let him not vow <b>to</b> walk in <b>the</b> dark, who has not seen <b>the</b> nightfall.”
<br>   “Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Or break <b>it</b>,” said Elrond. “Look not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, <b>and</b> may <b>the</b> blessing <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men <b>and</b> all Free Folk go with you. May <b>the</b> stars shine upon your faces!”
<br>   “Good .. . good luck!” cried Bilbo, stuttering with <b>the</b> cold. “I don't suppose you will be able <b>to</b> keep a diary, Frodo my lad, <b>but</b> I shall expect a full account when you get back. And don't be too long! Farewell!”
<br>   Many others <b>of</b> Elrond's household stood in <b>the</b> shadows <b>and</b> watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There was <b>no</b> laughter, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> song <b>or</b> music. At last they turned away <b>and</b> faded silently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusk.
<br>   They crossed <b>the</b> bridge <b>and</b> wound slowly up <b>the</b> long steep paths that led out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloven vale <b>of</b> Rivendell; <b>and</b> they came at length <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high moor where <b>the</b> wind hissed through <b>the</b> heather. Then with one glance at <b>the</b> Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   At <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen they left <b>the</b> Road <b>and</b> turning southwards went <b>on</b> <b>by</b> narrow paths among <b>the</b> folded lands. Their purpose was <b>to</b> hold this course west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains for many miles <b>and</b> days. The country was much rougher <b>and</b> more barren than in <b>the</b> green vale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River in Wilderland <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range, <b>and</b> their going would be slow; <b>but</b> they hoped in this way <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> notice <b>of</b> unfriendly eyes. The spies <b>of</b> Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> paths were little known except <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Rivendell.
<br>   Gandalf walked in front, <b>and</b> with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in <b>the</b> dark. The others were in file behind, <b>and</b> Legolas whose eyes were keen was <b>the</b> rearguard. The first part <b>of</b> their journey was hard <b>and</b> dreary, <b>and</b> Frodo remembered little <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, save <b>the</b> wind. For many sunless days an icy blast came from <b>the</b> Mountains in <b>the</b> east, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> garment seemed able <b>to</b> keep out its searching fingers. Though <b>the</b> Company was well clad, they seldom felt warm, either moving <b>or</b> at rest. They slept uneasily during <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, in some hollow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land, <b>or</b> hidden under <b>the</b> tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In <b>the</b> late afternoon they were roused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> watch, <b>and</b> took their chief meal: cold <b>and</b> cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk <b>the</b> lighting <b>of</b> a fire. In <b>the</b> evening they went <b>on</b> again, always as nearly southward as they could find a way.
<br>   At first <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits that although they walked <b>and</b> stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, <b>and</b> getting nowhere. Each day <b>the</b> land looked much <b>the</b> same as <b>it</b> had <b>the</b> day before. Yet steadily <b>the</b> mountains were drawing nearer. South <b>of</b> Rivendell they rose ever higher, <b>and</b> bent westwards; <b>and</b> about <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main range there was tumbled an ever wider land <b>of</b> bleak hills, <b>and</b> deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few <b>and</b> winding, <b>and</b> led them often only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> some sheer fall, <b>or</b> down <b>into</b> treacherous swamps.
<br>   They had been a fortnight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way when <b>the</b> weather changed. The wind suddenly fell <b>and</b> then veered round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. The swift-flowing clouds lifted <b>and</b> melted away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun came out, pale <b>and</b> bright. There came a cold clear dawn at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a long stumbling night-march. The travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly-trees whose grey-green trunks seemed <b>to</b> have been built out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very stone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills. Their dark leaves shone <b>and</b> their berries glowed red in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rising sun.
<br>   Away in <b>the</b> south Frodo could see <b>the</b> dim shapes <b>of</b> lofty mountains that seemed now <b>to</b> stand across <b>the</b> path that <b>the</b> Company was taking. At <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> this high range rose three peaks; <b>the</b> tallest <b>and</b> nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still largely in <b>the</b> shadow, <b>but</b> where <b>the</b> sunlight slanted upon <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> glowed red.
<br>   Gandalf stood at Frodo's side <b>and</b> looked out under his hand. “We have done well,” he said. “We have reached <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country that Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its name. Five-<b>and</b>-forty leagues as <b>the</b> crow flies we have come, though many long miles further our feet have walked. The land <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weather will be milder now, <b>but</b> perhaps all <b>the</b> more dangerous.”
<br>   “Dangerous <b>or</b> not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,” said Frodo, throwing back his hood <b>and</b> letting <b>the</b> morning light fall <b>on</b> his face.
<br>   “But <b>the</b> mountains are ahead <b>of</b> us,” said Pippin. “We must have turned eastwards in <b>the</b> night.”
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf. “But you see further ahead in <b>the</b> clear light. Beyond those peaks <b>the</b> range bends round south-west. There are many maps in Elrond's house, <b>but</b> I suppose you never thought <b>to</b> look at them?”
<br>   “Yes I did, sometimes,” said Pippin, “<b>but</b> I don't remember them. Frodo has a better head for that sort <b>of</b> thing.”
<br>   “I need <b>no</b> map,” said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, <b>and</b> was gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. “There is <b>the</b> land where our fathers worked <b>of</b> old, <b>and</b> we have wrought <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> those mountains <b>into</b> many works <b>of</b> metal <b>and</b> <b>of</b> stone, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> many songs <b>and</b> tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shath?r.
<br>   “Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, <b>but</b> I know them <b>and</b> their names, for under them lies Khazad-d?m, <b>the</b> Dwarrowdelf, that is now called <b>the</b> Black Pit, Moria in <b>the</b> Elvish tongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, <b>the</b> Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; <b>and</b> beyond him are Silvertine <b>and</b> Cloudyhead: Celebdil <b>the</b> White, <b>and</b> Fanuidhol <b>the</b> Grey, that we call Zirak-zigil <b>and</b> Bundushath?r.
<br>   “There <b>the</b> Misty Mountains divide, <b>and</b> between their arms lies <b>the</b> deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, <b>the</b> Dimrill Dale, which <b>the</b> Elves call Nanduhirion.”
<br>   “It is for <b>the</b> Dimrill Dale that we are making,” said Gandalf. “If we climb <b>the</b> pass that is called <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate, under <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> Caradhras, we shall come down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep vale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves. There lies <b>the</b> Mirrormere, <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> River Silverlode rises in its icy springs.”
<br>   “Dark is <b>the</b> water <b>of</b> Kheled-z?ram,” said Gimli, “<b>and</b> cold are <b>the</b> springs <b>of</b> Kibil-n?la. My heart trembles at <b>the</b> thought that I may see them soon.”
<br>   “May you have joy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight, my good dwarf l” said Gandalf. “But whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down <b>the</b> Silverlode <b>into</b> <b>the</b> secret woods, <b>and</b> so <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great River, <b>and</b> then –”
<br>   He paused.
<br>   “Yes, <b>and</b> where then?” asked Merry.
<br>   “To <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey—in <b>the</b> end,” said Gandalf. “We cannot look too far ahead. Let us be glad that <b>the</b> first stage is safely over. I think we will rest here, not only today <b>but</b> tonight as well. There is a wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before <b>it</b> wholly forgets <b>the</b> Elves, if once they dwelt there.”
<br>   “That is true,” said Legolas. “But <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> this land were <b>of</b> a race strange <b>to</b> us <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silvan folk, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grass do not now remember them: Only I hear <b>the</b> stones lament them: deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; <b>but</b> they are gone. They are gone. They sought <b>the</b> Havens long ago.”
<br>   That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded <b>by</b> great bushes <b>of</b> holly, <b>and</b> their supper-breakfast was merrier than <b>it</b> had been since they set out. They did not hurry <b>to</b> bed afterwards, for they expected <b>to</b> have all <b>the</b> night <b>to</b> sleep in, <b>and</b> they did not mean <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> again until <b>the</b> evening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next day. Only Aragorn was silent <b>and</b> restless. After a while he left <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> wandered <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ridge; there he stood in <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> a tree, looking out southwards <b>and</b> westwards, with his head posed as if he was listening. Then he returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell <b>and</b> looked down at <b>the</b> others laughing <b>and</b> talking.
<br>   “What is <b>the</b> matter, Strider?” Merry called up. “What are you looking for? Do you miss <b>the</b> East Wind?”
<br>   “No indeed,” he answered. “But I miss something. I have been in <b>the</b> country <b>of</b> Hollin in many seasons. No folk dwell here now, <b>but</b> many other creatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things <b>but</b> you are silent. I can feel <b>it</b>. There is <b>no</b> sound for miles about us, <b>and</b> your voices seem <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> ground echo. I do not understand <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. “But what do you guess is <b>the</b> reason?” he asked. “Is there more in <b>it</b> than surprise at seeing four hobbits, not <b>to</b> mention <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> us, where people are so seldom seen <b>or</b> heard?”
<br>   “I hope that is <b>it</b>,” answered Aragorn. “But I have a sense <b>of</b> watchfulness, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> fear, that I have never had here before.”
<br>   "Then we must be more careful,” said Gandalf. “If you bring a Ranger with you, <b>it</b> is well <b>to</b> pay attention <b>to</b> him, especially if <b>the</b> Ranger is Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, <b>and</b> set <b>the</b> watch.”
<br>   It was Sam's turn that day <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> first watch, <b>but</b> Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep. Then <b>the</b> silence grew until even Sam felt <b>it</b>. The breathing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pony's tail <b>and</b> <b>the</b> occasional movements <b>of</b> his feet became loud noises. Sam could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around him, <b>and</b> over all hung a clear blue sky, as <b>the</b> Sun rode up from <b>the</b> East. Away in <b>the</b> South a dark patch appeared, <b>and</b> grew, <b>and</b> drove north like flying smoke in <b>the</b> wind.
<br>   “What's that, Strider? It don't look like a cloud,” said Sam in a whisper <b>to</b> Aragorn. He made <b>no</b> answer, he was gazing intently at <b>the</b> sky; <b>but</b> before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching. Flocks <b>of</b> birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling <b>and</b> circling, <b>and</b> traversing all <b>the</b> land as if they were searching for something; <b>and</b> they were steadily drawing nearer.
<br>   “Lie flat <b>and</b> still!” hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shade <b>of</b> a holly-bush; for a whole regiment <b>of</b> birds had broken away suddenly from <b>the</b> main host, <b>and</b> came, flying low, straight towards <b>the</b> ridge. Sam thought they were a kind <b>of</b> crow <b>of</b> large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over <b>the</b> ground below, one harsh croak was heard.
<br>   Not until they had dwindled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance, north <b>and</b> west, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up <b>and</b> went <b>and</b> wakened Gandalf.
<br>   “Regiments <b>of</b> black crows are flying over all <b>the</b> land between <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood,” he said, “<b>and</b> they have passed over Hollin. They are not natives here; they are crebain out <b>of</b> Fangorn <b>and</b> Dunland. I do not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing; <b>but</b> I think they are spying out <b>the</b> land. I have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in <b>the</b> sky. I think we ought <b>to</b> move again this evening. Hollin is <b>no</b> longer wholesome for us: <b>it</b> is being watched.”
<br>   “And in that case so is <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate,” said Gandalf; “<b>and</b> how we can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think <b>of</b> that when we must. As for moving as soon as <b>it</b> is dark, I am afraid that you are right.”
<br>   “Luckily our fire made little smoke, <b>and</b> had burned low before <b>the</b> crebain came,” said Aragorn. “It must be put out <b>and</b> not lit again.”
<br>   “Well if that isn't a plague <b>and</b> a nuisance!” said Pippin. The news: <b>no</b> fire, <b>and</b> a move again <b>by</b> night, had been broken <b>to</b> him, as soon as he woke in <b>the</b> late afternoon. “All because <b>of</b> a pack <b>of</b> crows! I had looked forward <b>to</b> a real good meal tonight: something hot.”
<br>   “Well, you can go <b>on</b> looking forward,” said Gandalf. “There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe <b>to</b> smoke in comfort, <b>and</b> warmer feet. However, we are certain <b>of</b> one thing at any rate: <b>it</b> will get warmer as we get south.”
<br>   “Too warm, I shouldn't wonder,” muttered Sam <b>to</b> Frodo. “But I'm beginning <b>to</b> think <b>it</b>'s time we got a sight <b>of</b> that Fiery Mountain <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, so <b>to</b> speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn, <b>or</b> whatever its name is, might be <b>it</b>, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!” Maps conveyed nothing <b>to</b> Sam's mind, <b>and</b> all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out <b>of</b> his reckoning.
<br>   All that day <b>the</b> Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over now <b>and</b> again; <b>but</b> as <b>the</b> westering Sun grew red they disappeared southwards. At dusk <b>the</b> Company set out, <b>and</b> turning now half east they steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly red in <b>the</b> last light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vanished Sun. One <b>by</b> one white stars sprang forth as <b>the</b> sky faded.
<br>   Guided <b>by</b> Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked <b>to</b> Frodo like <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> an ancient road, that had once been broad <b>and</b> well planned, from Hollin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain-pass. The Moon, now at <b>the</b> full, rose over <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> cast a pale light in which <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> stones were black. Many <b>of</b> them looked <b>to</b> have been worked <b>by</b> hands, though now they lay tumbled <b>and</b> ruinous in a bleak, barren land.
<br>   It was <b>the</b> cold chill hour before <b>the</b> first stir <b>of</b> dawn, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moon was low. Frodo looked up at <b>the</b> sky. Suddenly he saw <b>or</b> felt a shadow pass over <b>the</b> high stars, as if for a moment they faded <b>and</b> then flashed out again. He shivered.
<br>   “Did you see anything pass over?” he whispered <b>to</b> Gandalf, who was just ahead.
<br>   “No, <b>but</b> I felt <b>it</b>, whatever <b>it</b> was,” he answered. “It may be nothing, only a wisp <b>of</b> thin cloud.”
<br>   “It was moving fast then,” muttered Aragorn, “<b>and</b> not with <b>the</b> wind.”
<br>   Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even brighter than before. But <b>the</b> air was chill again; already <b>the</b> wind was turning back towards <b>the</b> east. For two more nights they marched <b>on</b>, climbing steadily <b>but</b> ever more slowly as their road wound up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mountains towered up, nearer <b>and</b> nearer. On <b>the</b> third morning Caradhras rose before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, <b>but</b> with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood.
<br>   There was a black look in <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun was wan. The wind had gone now round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-east. Gandalf snuffed <b>the</b> air <b>and</b> looked back.
<br>   “Winter deepens behind us,” he said quietly <b>to</b> Aragorn. “The heights away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their shoulders. Tonight we shall be <b>on</b> our way high up towards <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate. We may well be seen <b>by</b> watchers <b>on</b> that narrow path, <b>and</b> waylaid <b>by</b> some evil; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you think <b>of</b> your course now, Aragorn?”
<br>   Frodo overheard these words, <b>and</b> understood that Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before. He listened anxiously.
<br>   “I think <b>no</b> good <b>of</b> our course from beginning <b>to</b> end, as you know well, Gandalf,” answered Aragorn. “And perils known <b>and</b> unknown will grow as we go <b>on</b>. But we must go <b>on</b>; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is <b>no</b> good our delaying <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. Further south there are <b>no</b> passes, till one comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gap <b>of</b> Rohan. I do not trust that way since your news <b>of</b> Saruman. Who knows which side now <b>the</b> marshals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse-lords serve?”
<br>   “Who knows indeed!” said Gandalf. “But there is another way, <b>and</b> not <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pass <b>of</b> Caradhras: <b>the</b> dark <b>and</b> secret way that we have spoken <b>of</b>.”
<br>   “But let us not speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again! Not yet. Say nothing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others I beg, not until <b>it</b> is plain that there is <b>no</b> other way.”
<br>   “We must decide before we go further,” answered Gandalf.
<br>   “Then let us weigh <b>the</b> matter in our minds, while <b>the</b> others rest <b>and</b> sleep,” said Aragorn.
<br>   In <b>the</b> late afternoon, while <b>the</b> others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn went aside together <b>and</b> stood looking at Caradhras. Its sides were now dark <b>and</b> sullen, <b>and</b> its head was in grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering which way <b>the</b> debate would go. When they returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company Gandalf spoke, <b>and</b> then he knew that <b>it</b> had been decided <b>to</b> face <b>the</b> weather <b>and</b> <b>the</b> high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was <b>the</b> other dark <b>and</b> secret way, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> very mention <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had seemed <b>to</b> fill Aragorn with dismay, <b>and</b> Frodo was glad that <b>it</b> had been abandoned.
<br>   “From signs that we have seen lately,” said Gandalf, “I fear that <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate may be watched; <b>and</b> also I have doubts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather that is coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all <b>the</b> speed that we can. Even so <b>it</b> will take us more than two marches before we reach <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can get ready.”
<br>   “I will add a word <b>of</b> advice, if I may,” said Boromir. “I was born under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains <b>and</b> know something <b>of</b> journeys in <b>the</b> high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if <b>no</b> worse, before we come down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. It will not help us <b>to</b> keep so secret that we are frozen <b>to</b> death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees <b>and</b> bushes, each <b>of</b> us should carry a faggot <b>of</b> wood, as large as he can bear.”
<br>   “And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?” said Sam. The pony looked at him mournfully.
<br>   “Very well,” said Gandalf. “But we must not use <b>the</b> wood—not unless <b>it</b> is a choice between fire <b>and</b> death.”
<br>   The Company set out again with good speed at first; <b>but</b> soon their way became steep <b>and</b> difficult. The twisting <b>and</b> climbing road had in many places almost disappeared, <b>and</b> was blocked with many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among <b>the</b> rocks. By midnight they had climbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great mountains. The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall <b>of</b> cliffs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, above which <b>the</b> grim flanks <b>of</b> Caradhras towered up invisible in <b>the</b> gloom; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right was a gulf <b>of</b> darkness where <b>the</b> land fell suddenly <b>into</b> a deep ravine.
<br>   Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope <b>and</b> halted for a moment at <b>the</b> top. Frodo felt a soft touch <b>on</b> his face. He put out his arm <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> dim white flakes <b>of</b> snow settling <b>on</b> his sleeve.
<br>   They went <b>on</b>. But before long <b>the</b> snow was falling fast, filling all <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> swirling <b>into</b> Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn only a pace <b>or</b> two ahead could hardly be seen.
<br>   “I don't like this at all,” panted Sam just behind. “Snow's all right <b>on</b> a fine morning, <b>but</b> I like <b>to</b> be in bed while <b>it</b>'s falling. I wish this lot would go off <b>to</b> Hobbiton! Folk might welcome <b>it</b> there.” Except <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high moors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> was regarded as a pleasant event <b>and</b> a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember <b>the</b> Fell Winter <b>of</b> 1311, when <b>the</b> white wolves invaded <b>the</b> Shire over <b>the</b> frozen Brandywine.
<br>   Gandalf halted. Snow was thick <b>on</b> his hood <b>and</b> shoulders; <b>it</b> was already ankle-deep about his boots.
<br>   "This is what I feared,” he said. “What do you say now, Aragorn?”
<br>   “That I feared <b>it</b> too,” Aragorn answered, “<b>but</b> less than other things. I knew <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> snow, though <b>it</b> seldom falls heavily so far south, save high up in <b>the</b> mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down, where <b>the</b> paths are usually open all <b>the</b> winter.”
<br>   “I wonder if this is a contrivance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy,” said Boromir. “They say in my land that he can govern <b>the</b> storms in <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Shadow that stand upon <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Mordor. He has strange powers <b>and</b> many allies.”
<br>   “His arm has grown long indeed,” said Gimli, “if he can draw snow down from <b>the</b> North <b>to</b> trouble us here three hundred leagues away.”
<br>   “His arm has grown long,” said Gandalf.
<br>   While they were halted, <b>the</b> wind died down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow slackened until <b>it</b> almost ceased. They tramped <b>on</b> again. But they had not gone more than a furlong when <b>the</b> storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found <b>it</b> hard <b>to</b> keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind <b>the</b> taller folk, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was plain that they could not go much further, if <b>the</b> snow continued. Frodo's feet felt like lead. Pippin was dragging behind. Even Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged.
<br>   The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come <b>to</b> an agreement without any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises in <b>the</b> darkness round them. It may have been only a trick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind in <b>the</b> cracks <b>and</b> gullies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocky wall, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sounds were those <b>of</b> shrill cries, <b>and</b> wild howls <b>of</b> laughter. Stones began <b>to</b> fall from <b>the</b> mountain-side, whistling over their heads, <b>or</b> crashing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path beside them. Every now <b>and</b> again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above.
<br>   “We cannot go further tonight,” said Boromir. “Let those call <b>it</b> <b>the</b> wind who will; there are fell voices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air; <b>and</b> these stones are aimed at us.”
<br>   “I do call <b>it</b> <b>the</b> wind,” said Aragorn. “But that does not make what you say untrue. There are many evil <b>and</b> unfriendly things in <b>the</b> world that have little love for those that go <b>on</b> two legs, <b>and</b> yet are not in league with Sauron, <b>but</b> have purposes <b>of</b> their own. Some have been in this world longer than he.”
<br>   “Caradhras was called <b>the</b> Cruel, <b>and</b> had an ill name, said Gimli, “long years ago, when rumour <b>of</b> Sauron had not been heard in these lands.”
<br>   “It matters little who is <b>the</b> enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; said Gandalf.
<br>   “But what can we do?” cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning <b>on</b> Merry <b>and</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> he was shivering.
<br>   “Either stop where we are, <b>or</b> go back,” said Gandalf. “It is <b>no</b> good going <b>on</b>. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves <b>the</b> cliff <b>and</b> runs <b>into</b> a wide shallow trough at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a long hard slope. We should have <b>no</b> shelter there from snow, <b>or</b> stones—<b>or</b> anything else.”
<br>   “And <b>it</b> is <b>no</b> good going back while <b>the</b> storm holds,” said Aragorn. “We have passed <b>no</b> place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way up that offered more shelter than this cliff-wall we are under now.”
<br>   “Shelter!” muttered Sam. “If this is shelter, then one wall <b>and</b> <b>no</b> roof make a house.”
<br>   The Company now gathered together as close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cliff as they could. It faced southwards, <b>and</b> near <b>the</b> bottom <b>it</b> leaned out a little, so that they hoped <b>it</b> would give them some protection from <b>the</b> northerly wind <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow flowed down in ever denser clouds.
<br>   They huddled together with their backs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. Bill <b>the</b> pony stood patiently <b>but</b> dejectedly in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits, <b>and</b> screened them a little; <b>but</b> before long <b>the</b> drifting snow was above his hocks, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> went <b>on</b> mounting. If they had had <b>no</b> larger companions <b>the</b> hobbits would soon have been entirely buried.
<br>   A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast <b>into</b> a warm <b>and</b> hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearth he heard Bilbo's voice speaking. I don't think much <b>of</b> your diary, he said. Snowstorms <b>on</b> January <b>the</b> twelfth: there was <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> come back <b>to</b> report that!
<br>   But I wanted rest <b>and</b> sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, <b>and</b> he came back painfully <b>to</b> wakefulness. Boromir had lifted him off <b>the</b> ground out <b>of</b> a nest <b>of</b> snow.
<br>   “This will be <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> halflings, Gandalf,” said Boromir. “It is useless <b>to</b> sit here until <b>the</b> snow goes over our heads. We must do something <b>to</b> save ourselves.”
<br>   “Give them this,” said Gandalf, searching in his pack <b>and</b> drawing out a leathern flask. “Just a mouthful each—for all <b>of</b> us. It is very precious. It is miruvor, <b>the</b> cordial <b>of</b> Imladris. Elrond gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me at our parting. Pass <b>it</b> round!”
<br>   As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warm <b>and</b> fragrant liquor he felt a new strength <b>of</b> heart, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived <b>and</b> found fresh hope <b>and</b> vigour. But <b>the</b> snow did not relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind blew louder.
<br>   “What do you say <b>to</b> fire?” asked Boromir suddenly. “The choice seems near now between fire <b>and</b> death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when <b>the</b> snow has covered us, <b>but</b> that will not help us.”
<br>   “You may make a fire, if you can,” answered Gandalf. “If there are any watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire <b>or</b> <b>no</b>.” But though they had brought wood <b>and</b> kindlings <b>by</b> <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> Boromir, <b>it</b> passed <b>the</b> skill <b>of</b> Elf <b>or</b> even Dwarf <b>to</b> strike a flame that would hold amid <b>the</b> swirling wind <b>or</b> catch in <b>the</b> wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held <b>it</b> aloft for a moment, <b>and</b> then with a word <b>of</b> command, naur an edraith ammen! he thrust <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his staff <b>into</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. At once a great spout <b>of</b> green <b>and</b> blue flame sprang out, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wood flared <b>and</b> sputtered.
<br>   “If there are any <b>to</b> see, then I at least am revealed <b>to</b> them,” he said. “I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from Rivendell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> Anduin.”
<br>   But <b>the</b> Company cared <b>no</b> longer for watchers <b>or</b> unfriendly eyes. Their hearts were rejoiced <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. The wood burned merrily; <b>and</b> though all round <b>it</b> <b>the</b> snow hissed, <b>and</b> pools <b>of</b> slush crept under their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at <b>the</b> blaze. There they stood, stooping in a circle round <b>the</b> little dancing <b>and</b> blowing flames. A red light was <b>on</b> their tired <b>and</b> anxious faces; behind them <b>the</b> night was like a black wall.
<br>   But <b>the</b> wood was burning fast, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow still fell.
<br>   The fire burned low. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last faggot was thrown <b>on</b>.
<br>   The night is getting old,” said Aragorn. “The dawn is not far off.”
<br>   “If any dawn can pierce these clouds,” said Gimli.
<br>   Boromir stepped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>and</b> stared up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> blackness. “The snow is growing less,” he said, “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind is quieter.”
<br>   Frodo gazed wearily at <b>the</b> flakes still falling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>to</b> be revealed white for a moment in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dying fire; <b>but</b> for a long time he could see <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep was beginning <b>to</b> creep over him again, he was aware that <b>the</b> wind had indeed fallen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flakes were becoming larger <b>and</b> fewer. Very slowly a dim light began <b>to</b> grow. At last <b>the</b> snow stopped altogether.
<br>   As <b>the</b> light grew stronger <b>it</b> showed a silent shrouded world. Below their refuge were white humps <b>and</b> domes <b>and</b> shapeless deeps beneath which <b>the</b> path that they had trodden was altogether lost; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> snow.
<br>   Gimli looked up <b>and</b> shook his head. “Caradhras has not forgiven us.” he said. “He has more snow yet <b>to</b> fling at us, if we go <b>on</b>. The sooner we go back <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> better.”
<br>   To this all agreed, <b>but</b> their retreat was now difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only a few paces from <b>the</b> ashes <b>of</b> their fire <b>the</b> snow lay many feet deep, higher than <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits; in places <b>it</b> had been scooped <b>and</b> piled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>into</b> great drifts against <b>the</b> cliff.
<br>   “If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,” said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, <b>and</b> he alone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company remained still light <b>of</b> heart.
<br>   “If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch <b>the</b> Sun <b>to</b> save us,” answered Gandalf. “But I must have something <b>to</b> work <b>on</b>. I cannot burn snow.”
<br>   “Well,” said Boromir, “when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as we say in my country. The strongest <b>of</b> us must seek a way. See! Though all is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder <b>of</b> rock down yonder. It was there that <b>the</b> snow first began <b>to</b> burden us. If we could reach that point, maybe <b>it</b> would prove easier beyond. It is <b>no</b> more than a furlong off, I guess.”
<br>   “Then let us force a path thither, you <b>and</b> I!” said Aragorn.
<br>   Aragorn was <b>the</b> tallest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, <b>but</b> Boromir, little less in height, was broader <b>and</b> heavier in build. He led <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> Aragorn followed him. Slowly they moved off, <b>and</b> were soon toiling heavily. In places <b>the</b> snow was breast-high, <b>and</b> often Boromir seemed <b>to</b> be swimming <b>or</b> burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.
<br>   Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, <b>and</b> then he turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman plough, <b>but</b> choose an otter for swimming, <b>and</b> for running light over grass <b>and</b> leaf <b>or</b> over snow-an Elf.”
<br>   With that he sprang forth nimbly, <b>and</b> then Frodo noticed as if for <b>the</b> first time, though he had long known <b>it</b>, that <b>the</b> Elf had <b>no</b> boots, <b>but</b> wore only light shoes, as he always did, <b>and</b> his feet made little imprint in <b>the</b> snow.
<br>   “Farewell!” he said <b>to</b> Gandalf. “I go <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Sun!” Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away, <b>and</b> quickly overtaking <b>the</b> toiling men, with a wave <b>of</b> his hand he passed them, <b>and</b> sped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> vanished round <b>the</b> rocky turn.
<br>   The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn dwindled <b>into</b> black specks in <b>the</b> whiteness. At length they too passed from sight. The time dragged <b>on</b>. The clouds lowered, <b>and</b> now a few flakes <b>of</b> snow came curling down again.
<br>   An hour, maybe, went <b>by</b>, though <b>it</b> seemed far longer, <b>and</b> then at last they saw Legolas coming back. At <b>the</b> same time Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn reappeared round <b>the</b> bend far behind him <b>and</b> came labouring up <b>the</b> slope.
<br>   “Well,” cried Legolas as he ran up, “I have not brought <b>the</b> Sun. She is walking in <b>the</b> blue fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> a little wreath <b>of</b> snow <b>on</b> this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam <b>of</b> good hope for those who are doomed <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> feet. There is <b>the</b> greatest wind-drift <b>of</b> all just beyond <b>the</b> turn, <b>and</b> there our Strong Men were almost buried. They despaired, until I returned <b>and</b> told them that <b>the</b> drift was little wider than a wall. And <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>the</b> snow suddenly grows less, while further down <b>it</b> is <b>no</b> more than a white coverlet <b>to</b> cool a hobbit's toes.”
<br>   “Ah, <b>it</b> is as I said,” growled Gimli. “It was <b>no</b> ordinary storm. It is <b>the</b> ill will <b>of</b> Caradhras. He does not love Elves <b>and</b> Dwarves, <b>and</b> that drift was laid <b>to</b> cut off our escape.”
<br>   “But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,” said Boromir, who came up at that moment. “And doughty Men too, if I may say <b>it</b>; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we have thrust a lane through <b>the</b> drift; <b>and</b> for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves.”
<br>   “But how are we <b>to</b> get down there, even if you have cut through <b>the</b> drift?” said Pippin, voicing <b>the</b> thought <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Have hope!” said Boromir. “I am weary, <b>but</b> I still have some strength left, <b>and</b> Aragorn too. We will bear <b>the</b> little folk. The others <b>no</b> doubt will make shift <b>to</b> tread <b>the</b> path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will begin with you.”
<br>   He lifted up <b>the</b> hobbit. “Cling <b>to</b> my back! I shall need my arms” he said <b>and</b> strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at his strength, seeing <b>the</b> passage that he had already forced with <b>no</b> other tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening <b>the</b> track for those who followed, thrusting <b>the</b> snow aside as he went.
<br>   They came at length <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great drift. It was flung across <b>the</b> mountain-path like a sheer <b>and</b> sudden wall, <b>and</b> its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than twice <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> Boromir; <b>but</b> through <b>the</b> middle a passage had been beaten, rising <b>and</b> falling like a bridge. On <b>the</b> far side Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were set down, <b>and</b> there they waited with Legolas for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> arrive.
<br>   After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in <b>the</b> narrow <b>but</b> now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among <b>the</b> baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through <b>the</b> lane; <b>but</b> hardly had Frodo touched <b>the</b> ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall <b>of</b> stones <b>and</b> slithering snow. The spray <b>of</b> <b>it</b> half blinded <b>the</b> Company as they crouched against <b>the</b> cliff, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> air cleared again they saw that <b>the</b> path was blocked behind them.
<br>   “Enough, enough!” cried Gimli. “We are departing as quickly as we may!” And indeed with that last stroke <b>the</b> malice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain seemed <b>to</b> be expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that <b>the</b> invaders had been beaten off <b>and</b> would not dare <b>to</b> return. The threat <b>of</b> snow lifted; <b>the</b> clouds began <b>to</b> break <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light grew broader.
<br>   As Legolas had reported, they found that <b>the</b> snow became steadily more shallow as they went down, so that even <b>the</b> hobbits could trudge along. Soon they all stood once more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flat shelf at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steep slope where they had felt <b>the</b> first flakes <b>of</b> snow <b>the</b> night before.
<br>   The morning was now far advanced. From <b>the</b> high place they looked back westwards over <b>the</b> lower lands. Far away in <b>the</b> tumble <b>of</b> country that lay at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain was <b>the</b> dell from which they had started <b>to</b> climb <b>the</b> pass.
<br>   Frodo's legs ached. He was chilled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bone <b>and</b> hungry; <b>and</b> his head was dizzy as he thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>and</b> painful march downhill. Black specks swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> black specks remained. In <b>the</b> distance below him, <b>but</b> still high above <b>the</b> lower foothills, dark dots were circling in <b>the</b> air.
<br>   “The birds again!” said Aragorn, pointing down.
<br>   “That cannot be helped now,” said Gandalf. “Whether they are good <b>or</b> evil, <b>or</b> have nothing <b>to</b> do with us at all, we must go down at once. Not even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> knees <b>of</b> Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!”
<br>   A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate, <b>and</b> stumbled wearily down <b>the</b> slope. Caradhras had defeated them.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>A JOURNEY IN THE DARK
<br>
<br>   It was evening, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey light was again waning fast, when they halted for <b>the</b> night. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in deepening dusk, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miruvor <b>of</b> Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a council.
<br>   “We cannot, <b>of</b> course, go <b>on</b> again tonight,” he said. “The attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate has tired us out, <b>and</b> we must rest here for a while.”
<br>   “And then where are we <b>to</b> go? “asked Frodo.
<br>   “We still have our journey <b>and</b> our errand before us,” answered Gandalf. “We have <b>no</b> choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> Rivendell.”
<br>   Pippin's face brightened visibly at <b>the</b> mere mention <b>of</b> return <b>to</b> Rivendell; Merry <b>and</b> Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn <b>and</b> Boromir made <b>no</b> sign. Frodo looked troubled.
<br>   “I wish I was back there,” he said. “But how can I return without shame—unless there is indeed <b>no</b> other way, <b>and</b> we are already defeated?”
<br>   “You are right, Frodo,” said Gandalf: “<b>to</b> go back is <b>to</b> admit defeat <b>and</b> face worse defeat <b>to</b> come. If we go back now, then <b>the</b> Ring must remain there: we shall not be able <b>to</b> set out again. Then sooner <b>or</b> later Rivendell will be besieged, <b>and</b> after a brief <b>and</b> bitter time <b>it</b> will be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, <b>but</b> they are only shadows yet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power <b>and</b> terror they would possess if <b>the</b> Ruling Ring was <b>on</b> their master's hand again.”
<br>   “Then we must go <b>on</b>, if there is a way,” said Frodo with a sigh. Sam sank back <b>into</b> gloom.
<br>   “There is a way that we may attempt,” said Gandalf. “I thought from <b>the</b> beginning, when first I considered this journey, that we should try <b>it</b>. But <b>it</b> is not a pleasant way, <b>and</b> I have not spoken <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company before. Aragorn was against <b>it</b>, until <b>the</b> pass over <b>the</b> mountains had at least been tried.”
<br>   “If <b>it</b> is a worse road than <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate, then <b>it</b> must be evil indeed,” said Merry. “But you had better tell us about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> let us know <b>the</b> worst at once.”
<br>   “The road that I speak <b>of</b> leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mines <b>of</b> Moria,” said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all <b>the</b> others a dread fell at <b>the</b> mention <b>of</b> that name. Even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits <b>it</b> was a legend <b>of</b> vague fear:
<br>   “The road may lead <b>to</b> Moria, <b>but</b> how can we hope that <b>it</b> will lead through Moria? “said Aragorn darkly.
<br>   “It is a name <b>of</b> ill omen,” said Boromir. “Nor do I see <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> go there. If we cannot cross <b>the</b> mountains, let us journey southwards, until we come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gap <b>of</b> Rohan, where men are friendly <b>to</b> my people, taking <b>the</b> road that I followed <b>on</b> my way hither. Or we might pass <b>by</b> <b>and</b> cross <b>the</b> Isen <b>into</b> Langstrand <b>and</b> Lebennin, <b>and</b> so come <b>to</b> Gondor from <b>the</b> regions nigh <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea.”
<br>   “Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,” answered Gandalf. “Did you not hear what I told you <b>of</b> Saruman? With him I may have business <b>of</b> my own ere all is over. But <b>the</b> Ring must not come near Isengard, if that can <b>by</b> any means be prevented. The Gap <b>of</b> Rohan is closed <b>to</b> us while we go with <b>the</b> Bearer.
<br>   “As for <b>the</b> longer road: we cannot afford <b>the</b> time. We might spend a year in such a journey, <b>and</b> we should pass through many lands that are empty <b>and</b> harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both <b>of</b> Saruman <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy are <b>on</b> them. When you came north, Boromir, you were in <b>the</b> Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from <b>the</b> South <b>and</b> a matter <b>of</b> small concern <b>to</b> him: his mind was busy with <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring. But you return now as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring's Company, <b>and</b> you are in peril as long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that we go south under <b>the</b> naked sky.
<br>   “Since our open attempt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain-pass our plight has become more desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while, <b>and</b> cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go neither over <b>the</b> mountains, nor round them, <b>but</b> under them. That is a road at any rate that <b>the</b> Enemy will least expect us <b>to</b> take.”
<br>   “We do not know what he expects,” said Boromir. “He may watch all roads, likely <b>and</b> unlikely. In that case <b>to</b> enter Moria would be <b>to</b> walk <b>into</b> a trap, hardly better than knocking at <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower itself. The name <b>of</b> Moria is black.”
<br>   “You speak <b>of</b> what you do not know, when you liken Moria <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stronghold <b>of</b> Sauron,” answered Gandalf. “I alone <b>of</b> you have ever been in <b>the</b> dungeons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord, <b>and</b> only in his older <b>and</b> lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur. Those who pass <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> Barad-d?r do not return. But I would not lead you <b>into</b> Moria if there were <b>no</b> hope <b>of</b> coming out again. If there are Orcs there, <b>it</b> may prove ill for us, that is true. But most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orcs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains were scattered <b>or</b> destroyed in <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar; <b>but</b> there is a hope that Moria is still free.
<br>   “There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, <b>and</b> that in some deep hall <b>of</b> his fathers, Balin son <b>of</b> Fundin may be found. However <b>it</b> may prove, one must tread <b>the</b> path that need chooses!”
<br>   “I will tread <b>the</b> path with you, Gandalf! “said Gimli. “I will go <b>and</b> look <b>on</b> <b>the</b> halls <b>of</b> Durin, whatever may wait there-if you can find <b>the</b> doors that are shut.”
<br>   “Good, Gimli! “said Gandalf. “You encourage me. We will seek <b>the</b> hidden doors together. And we will come through. In <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves, a dwarf's head will be less easy <b>to</b> bewilder than Elves <b>or</b> Men <b>or</b> Hobbits. Yet <b>it</b> will not be <b>the</b> first time that I have been <b>to</b> Moria. I sought there long for Thr?in son <b>of</b> Thr?r after he was lost. I passed through, <b>and</b> I came out again alive!”
<br>   “I too once passed <b>the</b> Dimrill Gate,” said Aragorn quietly; “<b>but</b> though I also came out again, <b>the</b> memory is very evil. I do not wish <b>to</b> enter Moria a second time.”
<br>   “And I don't wish <b>to</b> enter <b>it</b> even once,” said Pippin.
<br>   “Nor me,” muttered Sam.
<br>   “Of course not! “said Gandalf. “Who would? But <b>the</b> question is: who will follow me, if I lead you there?”
<br>   “I will,” said Gimli eagerly.
<br>   “I will,” said Aragorn heavily. “You followed my lead almost <b>to</b> disaster in <b>the</b> snow, <b>and</b> have said <b>no</b> word <b>of</b> blame. I will follow your lead now—if this last warning does not move you. It is not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, nor <b>of</b> us others that I am thinking now, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> you, Gandalf. And I say <b>to</b> you: if you pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> Moria, beware!”
<br>   “I will not go,” said Boromir; “not unless <b>the</b> vote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole company is against me. What do Legolas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little folk say? The Ring-bearer's voice surely should be heard?”
<br>   “I do not wish <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> Moria,” said Legolas.
<br>   The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. “I do not wish <b>to</b> go,” he said; “<b>but</b> neither do I wish <b>to</b> refuse <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> Gandalf. I beg that there should be <b>no</b> vote, until we have slept <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Gandalf will get votes easier in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning than in this cold gloom. How <b>the</b> wind howls!”
<br>   At these words all fell <b>into</b> silent thought. They heard <b>the</b> wind hissing among <b>the</b> rocks <b>and</b> trees, <b>and</b> there was a howling <b>and</b> wailing round them in <b>the</b> empty spaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   Suddenly Aragorn leapt <b>to</b> his feet. “How <b>the</b> wind howls! “he cried. “It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains!”
<br>   “Need we wait until morning then? “said Gandalf. “It is as I said. The hunt is up! Even if we live <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> dawn, who now will wish <b>to</b> journey south <b>by</b> night with <b>the</b> wild wolves <b>on</b> his trail?”
<br>   “How far is Moria? “asked Boromir.
<br>   “There was a door south-west <b>of</b> Caradhras, some fifteen miles as <b>the</b> crow flies, <b>and</b> maybe twenty as <b>the</b> wolf runs,” answered Gandalf grimly.
<br>   “Then let us start as soon as <b>it</b> is light tomorrow, if we can,” said Boromir. “The wolf that one hears is worse than <b>the</b> orc that one fears.”
<br>   “True!” said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. “But where <b>the</b> warg howls, there also <b>the</b> orc prowls.”
<br>   “I wish I had taken Elrond's advice,” muttered Pippin <b>to</b> Sam. “I am <b>no</b> good after all. There is not enough <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed <b>of</b> Bandobras <b>the</b> Bullroarer in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don't ever remember feeling so wretched.”
<br>   “My heart's right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,” said Sam. “But we aren't etten yet, <b>and</b> there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager <b>it</b> isn't a wolf's belly.”
<br>   For their defence in <b>the</b> night <b>the</b> Company climbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small hill under which they had been sheltering. <b>it</b> was crowned with a knot <b>of</b> old <b>and</b> twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle <b>of</b> boulder stones. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> this they lit a fire, for there was <b>no</b> hope that darkness <b>and</b> silence would keep their trail from discovery <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hunting packs.
<br>   Round <b>the</b> fire they sat, <b>and</b> those that were not <b>on</b> guard dozed uneasily. Poor Bill <b>the</b> pony trembled <b>and</b> sweated where he stood. The howling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer <b>and</b> sometimes further off. In <b>the</b> dead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night many shining eyes were seen peering over <b>the</b> brow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. Some advanced almost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>of</b> stones. At a gap in <b>the</b> circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at them. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning his pack <b>to</b> <b>the</b> assault.
<br>   Gandalf stood up <b>and</b> strode forward, holding his staff aloft. “Listen, Hound <b>of</b> Sauron! “he cried. “Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul skin! I will shrivel you from tail <b>to</b> snout, if you come within this ring.”
<br>   The wolf snarled <b>and</b> sprang towards them with a great leap. At that moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his bow. There was a hideous yell, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaping shape thudded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground; <b>the</b> elvish arrow had pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished. Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn strode forward, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hill was deserted; <b>the</b> hunting packs had fled. All about them <b>the</b> darkness grew silent, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> cry came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sighing wind.
<br>   The night was old, <b>and</b> westward <b>the</b> waning moon was setting. gleaming fitfully through <b>the</b> breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started from sleep. Without warning a storm <b>of</b> howls broke out fierce <b>and</b> wild all about <b>the</b> camp. A great host <b>of</b> Wargs had gathered silently <b>and</b> was now attacking them from every side at once.
<br>   “Fling fuel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fire!” cried Gandalf <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “Draw your blades, <b>and</b> stand back <b>to</b> back!”
<br>   In <b>the</b> leaping light, as <b>the</b> fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over <b>the</b> ring <b>of</b> stones. More <b>and</b> more followed. Through <b>the</b> throat <b>of</b> one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir hewed <b>the</b> head off another. Beside them Gimli stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow <b>of</b> Legolas was singing.
<br>   In <b>the</b> wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly <b>to</b> grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like <b>the</b> monument <b>of</b> some ancient king <b>of</b> stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch <b>and</b> strode <b>to</b> meet <b>the</b> wolves. They gave back before him. High in <b>the</b> air he tossed <b>the</b> blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; <b>and</b> his voice rolled like thunder.
<br>   “Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!” he cried.
<br>   There was a roar <b>and</b> a crackle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tree above him burst <b>into</b> a leaf <b>and</b> bloom <b>of</b> blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top <b>to</b> tree-top. The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords <b>and</b> knives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenders shone <b>and</b> flickered. The last arrow <b>of</b> Legolas kindled in <b>the</b> air as <b>it</b> flew, <b>and</b> plunged burning <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> a great wolf-chieftain. All <b>the</b> others fled.
<br>   Slowly <b>the</b> fire died till nothing was left <b>but</b> falling ash <b>and</b> sparks; a bitter smoke curled above <b>the</b> burned tree-stumps, <b>and</b> blew darkly from <b>the</b> hill, as <b>the</b> first light <b>of</b> dawn came dimly in <b>the</b> sky. Their enemies were routed <b>and</b> did not return.
<br>   “What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin? “said Sam, sheIthing his sword. “Wolves won't get him. That was an eye-opener, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake! Nearly singed <b>the</b> hair off my head!”
<br>   When <b>the</b> full light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning came <b>no</b> signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolves were <b>to</b> be found, <b>and</b> they looked in vain for <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. No trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight remained <b>but</b> <b>the</b> charred trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrows <b>of</b> Legolas lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top. All were undamaged save one <b>of</b> which only <b>the</b> point was left.
<br>   “It is as I feared,” said Gandalf. “These were <b>no</b> ordinary wolves hunting for food in <b>the</b> wilderness. Let us eat quickly <b>and</b> go!”
<br>   That day <b>the</b> weather changed again, almost as if <b>it</b> was at <b>the</b> command <b>of</b> some power that had <b>no</b> longer any use for snow, since they had retreated from <b>the</b> pass, a power that wished now <b>to</b> have a clear light in which things that moved in <b>the</b> wild could be seen from far away. The wind had been turning through north <b>to</b> north-west during <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> now <b>it</b> failed. The clouds vanished southwards <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky was opened, high <b>and</b> blue. As they stood upon <b>the</b> hill-side, ready <b>to</b> depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over <b>the</b> mountain-tops.
<br>   “We must reach <b>the</b> doors before sunset,” said Gandalf, “<b>or</b> I fear we shall not reach them at all. It is not far, <b>but</b> our path may be winding, for here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, <b>and</b> only once have I been under <b>the</b> west wall <b>of</b> Moria, <b>and</b> that was long ago.
<br>   “There <b>it</b> lies,” he said, pointing away south-eastwards <b>to</b> where <b>the</b> mountains” sides fell sheer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows at their feet. In <b>the</b> distance could be dimly seen a line <b>of</b> bare cliffs, <b>and</b> in their midst, taller than <b>the</b> rest, one great grey wall. “When we left <b>the</b> pass I led you southwards, <b>and</b> not back <b>to</b> our starting point, as some <b>of</b> you may have noticed. It is well that I did so, for now we have several miles less <b>to</b> cross, <b>and</b> haste is needed. Let us go!”
<br>   “I do not know which <b>to</b> hope,” said Boromir grimly: “that Gandalf will find what he seeks, <b>or</b> that coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cliff we shall find <b>the</b> gates lost for ever. All choices seem ill, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be caught between wolves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>the</b> likeliest chance. Lead <b>on</b>!”
<br>   Gimli now walked ahead <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wizard's side, so eager was he <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> Moria. Together they led <b>the</b> Company back towards <b>the</b> mountains. The only road <b>of</b> old <b>to</b> Moria from <b>the</b> west had lain along <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> a stream, <b>the</b> Sirannon, that ran out from <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliffs near where <b>the</b> doors had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, <b>or</b> else <b>the</b> land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike <b>the</b> stream where he looked <b>to</b> find <b>it</b>, only a few miles southwards from their start.
<br>   The morning was passing towards noon, <b>and</b> still <b>the</b> Company wandered <b>and</b> scrambled in a barren country <b>of</b> red stones. Nowhere could they see any gleam <b>of</b> water <b>or</b> hear any sound <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. All was bleak <b>and</b> dry. Their hearts sank. They saw <b>no</b> living thing, <b>and</b> not a bird was in <b>the</b> sky; <b>but</b> what <b>the</b> night would bring, if <b>it</b> caught them in that lost land, none <b>of</b> them cared <b>to</b> think.
<br>   Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed <b>on</b> ahead, called back <b>to</b> them. He was standing <b>on</b> a knoll <b>and</b> pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. Hurrying up they saw below them a deep <b>and</b> narrow channel. It was empty <b>and</b> silent, <b>and</b> hardly a trickle <b>of</b> water flowed among <b>the</b> brown <b>and</b> red-stained stones <b>of</b> its bed; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> near side there was a path, much broken <b>and</b> decayed, that wound its way among <b>the</b> ruined walls <b>and</b> paving-stones <b>of</b> an ancient highroad.
<br>   “Ah! Here <b>it</b> is at last! “said Gandalf. “This is where <b>the</b> stream ran: Sirannon, <b>the</b> Gate-stream, they used <b>to</b> call <b>it</b>. But what has happened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water, I cannot guess; <b>it</b> used <b>to</b> be swift <b>and</b> noisy. Come! We must hurry <b>on</b>. We are late.”
<br>   The Company were footsore <b>and</b> tired; <b>but</b> they trudged doggedly along <b>the</b> rough <b>and</b> winding track for many miles. The sun turned from <b>the</b> noon <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> go west. After a brief halt <b>and</b> a hasty meal they went <b>on</b> again. Before them <b>the</b> mountains frowned, <b>but</b> their path lay in a deep trough <b>of</b> land <b>and</b> they could see only <b>the</b> higher shoulders <b>and</b> <b>the</b> far eastward peaks.
<br>   At length they came <b>to</b> a sharp bend. There <b>the</b> road, which had been veering southwards between <b>the</b> brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>and</b> a steep fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, turned <b>and</b> went due east again. Rounding <b>the</b> corner they saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken <b>and</b> jagged top. Over <b>it</b> a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that seemed <b>to</b> have been carved out <b>by</b> a fall that had once been strong <b>and</b> full.
<br>   “Indeed things have changed! “said Gandalf. “But there is <b>no</b> mistaking <b>the</b> place. There is all that remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stair Falls. If I remember right, there was a flight <b>of</b> steps cut in <b>the</b> rock at their side, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> main road wound away left <b>and</b> climbed with several loops up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level ground at <b>the</b> top. There used <b>to</b> be a shallow valley beyond <b>the</b> falls right up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Walls <b>of</b> Moria, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sirannon flowed through <b>it</b> with <b>the</b> road beside <b>it</b>. Let us go <b>and</b> see what things are like now!”
<br>   They found <b>the</b> stone steps without difficulty, <b>and</b> Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed <b>by</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> Frodo. When they reached <b>the</b> top they saw that they could go <b>no</b> further that way, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reason for <b>the</b> drying up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them <b>the</b> sinking Sun filled <b>the</b> cool western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset was reflected <b>on</b> its sullen surface. The Sirannon had been dammed <b>and</b> had filled all <b>the</b> valley. Beyond <b>the</b> ominous water were reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in <b>the</b> fading light: final <b>and</b> impassable. No sign <b>of</b> gate <b>or</b> entrance, not a fissure <b>or</b> crack could Frodo see in <b>the</b> frowning stone.
<br>   “There are <b>the</b> Walls <b>of</b> Moria,” said Gandalf, pointing across <b>the</b> water. “And there <b>the</b> Gate stood once upon a time, <b>the</b> Elven Door at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road from Hollin <b>by</b> which we have come. But this way is blocked. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, I guess, will wish <b>to</b> swim this gloomy water at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. It has an unwholesome look.”
<br>   “We must find a way round <b>the</b> northern edge,” said Gimli. “The first thing for <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> do is <b>to</b> climb up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> main path <b>and</b> see where that will lead us. Even if there were <b>no</b> lake, we could not get our baggage-pony up this stair.”
<br>   “But in any case we cannot take <b>the</b> poor beast <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mines,” said Gandalf. “The road under <b>the</b> mountains is a dark road, <b>and</b> there are places narrow <b>and</b> steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.”
<br>   “Poor old Bill! “said Frodo. “I had not thought <b>of</b> that. And poor Sam! I wonder what he will say?”
<br>   “I am sorry,” said Gandalf. “Poor Bill has been a useful companion <b>and</b> <b>it</b> goes <b>to</b> my heart <b>to</b> turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter <b>and</b> brought <b>no</b> animal, least <b>of</b> all this one that Sam is fond <b>of</b>, if I had had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged <b>to</b> take this road.”
<br>   The day was drawing <b>to</b> its end, <b>and</b> cold stars were glinting in <b>the</b> sky high above <b>the</b> sunset, when <b>the</b> Company, with all <b>the</b> speed they could, climbed up <b>the</b> slopes <b>and</b> reached <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. In breadth <b>it</b> looked <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> more than two <b>or</b> three furlongs at <b>the</b> widest point. How far <b>it</b> stretched away southward they could not see in <b>the</b> failing light; <b>but</b> its northern end was <b>no</b> more than half a mile from where they stood, <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> stony ridges that enclosed <b>the</b> valley <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water's edge there was a rim <b>of</b> open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile <b>or</b> two <b>to</b> go before they could reach <b>the</b> point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far shore that Gandalf was making for; <b>and</b> then he had still <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> doors.
<br>   When they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northernmost corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake they found a narrow creek that barred their way. It was green <b>and</b> stagnant, thrust out like a slimy arm towards <b>the</b> enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, <b>and</b> found that <b>the</b> water was shallow, <b>no</b> more than ankle-deep at <b>the</b> edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for under <b>the</b> weedy pools were sliding <b>and</b> greasy stones, <b>and</b> footing was treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at <b>the</b> touch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark unclean water <b>on</b> his feet.
<br>   As Sam, <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, led Bill up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dry ground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed <b>by</b> a plop, as if a fish had disturbed <b>the</b> still surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged with shadow in <b>the</b> waning light: great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in <b>the</b> lake. There was a bubbling noise, <b>and</b> then silence. The dusk deepened, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last gleams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunset were veiled in cloud.
<br>   Gandalf now pressed <b>on</b> at a great pace, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others followed as quickly as they could. They reached <b>the</b> strip <b>of</b> dry land between <b>the</b> lake <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cliffs: <b>it</b> was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, <b>and</b> encumbered with fallen rock <b>and</b> stones; <b>but</b> they found a way, hugging <b>the</b> cliff, <b>and</b> keeping as far from <b>the</b> dark water as they might. A mile southwards along <b>the</b> shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps <b>and</b> dead boughs were rotting in <b>the</b> shallows, <b>the</b> remains <b>it</b> seemed <b>of</b> old thickets, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> a hedge that had once lined <b>the</b> road across <b>the</b> drowned valley. But close under <b>the</b> cliff there stood, still strong <b>and</b> living, . two tall trees, larger than any trees <b>of</b> holly that Frodo had ever seen <b>or</b> imagined. Their great roots spread from <b>the</b> wall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water. Under <b>the</b> looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stair; <b>but</b> now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, <b>and</b> silent, throwing deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road.
<br>   “Well, here we are at last! “said Gandalf. “Here <b>the</b> Elven-way from Hollin ended. Holly was <b>the</b> token <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> that land, <b>and</b> they planted <b>it</b> here <b>to</b> mark <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> their domain; for <b>the</b> West-door was made chiefly for their use in their traffic with <b>the</b> Lords <b>of</b> Moria. Those were happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk <b>of</b> different race, even between Dwarves <b>and</b> Elves.”
<br>   “It was not <b>the</b> fault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves that <b>the</b> friendship waned,” said Gimli.
<br>   “I have not heard that <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> fault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves,” said Legolas.
<br>   “I have heard both,” said Gandalf; “<b>and</b> I will not give judgement now. But I beg you two, Legolas <b>and</b> Gimli, at least <b>to</b> be friends, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> help me. I need you both. The doors are shut <b>and</b> hidden, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sooner we find them <b>the</b> better. Night is at hand!”
<br>   Turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others he said: “While I am searching, will you each make ready <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> Mines? For here I fear we must say farewell <b>to</b> our good beast <b>of</b> burden. You must lay aside much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stuff that we brought against bitter weather: you will not need <b>it</b> inside, nor, I hope, when we come through <b>and</b> journey <b>on</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> South. Instead each <b>of</b> us must take a share <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> pony carried, especially <b>the</b> food <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water-skins.”
<br>   “But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf! “cried Sam, angry <b>and</b> distressed. “I won't have <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> that's flat. After he has come so far <b>and</b> all!”
<br>   “I am sorry, Sam,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “But when <b>the</b> Door opens I do not think you will be able <b>to</b> drag your Bill inside, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> long dark <b>of</b> Moria. You will have <b>to</b> choose between Bill <b>and</b> your master.”
<br>   “He'd follow Mr. Frodo <b>into</b> a dragon's den, if I led him,” protested Sam. “It'd be nothing short <b>of</b> murder <b>to</b> turn him loose with all these wolves about.”
<br>   “It will be short <b>of</b> murder, I hope,” said Gandalf. He laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pony's head, <b>and</b> spoke in a low voice. “Go with words <b>of</b> guard <b>and</b> guiding <b>on</b> you,” he said. “You are a wise beast, <b>and</b> have learned much in Rivendell. Make your ways <b>to</b> places where you can find grass, <b>and</b> so come in time <b>to</b> Elrond's house, <b>or</b> wherever you wish <b>to</b> go.
<br>   “There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance <b>of</b> escaping wolves <b>and</b> getting home as we have.”
<br>   Sam stood sullenly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pony <b>and</b> returned <b>no</b> answer. Bill, seeming <b>to</b> understand well what was going <b>on</b>, nuzzled up <b>to</b> him, putting his nose <b>to</b> Sam's ear. Sam burst <b>into</b> tears, <b>and</b> fumbled with <b>the</b> straps, unlading all <b>the</b> pony's packs <b>and</b> throwing them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The others sorted out <b>the</b> goods, making a pile <b>of</b> all that could be left behind, <b>and</b> dividing up <b>the</b> rest.
<br>   When this was done they turned <b>to</b> watch Gandalf. He appeared <b>to</b> have done nothing. He was standing between <b>the</b> two trees gazing at <b>the</b> blank wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff, as if he would bore a hole <b>into</b> <b>it</b> with his eyes. Gimli was wandering about, tapping <b>the</b> stone here <b>and</b> there with his axe. Legolas was pressed against <b>the</b> rock, as if listening.
<br>   “Well, here we are <b>and</b> all ready,” said Merry; “<b>but</b> where are <b>the</b> Doors? I can't see any sign <b>of</b> them.”
<br>   “Dwarf-doors are not made <b>to</b> be seen when shut,” said Gimli. “They are invisible, <b>and</b> their own masters cannot find them <b>or</b> open them, if their secret is forgotten.”
<br>   “But this Door was not made <b>to</b> be a secret known only <b>to</b> Dwarves,” said Gandalf, coming suddenly <b>to</b> life <b>and</b> turning round. “Unless things are altogether changed, eyes that know what <b>to</b> look for may discover <b>the</b> signs.”
<br>   He walked forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. Right between <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees there was a smooth space, <b>and</b> over this he passed his hands <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro, muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back.
<br>   “Look!” he said. “Can you see anything now?”
<br>   The Moon now shone upon <b>the</b> grey face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock; <b>but</b> they could see nothing else for a while. Then slowly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface, where <b>the</b> wizard's hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins <b>of</b> silver running in <b>the</b> stone. At first they were <b>no</b> more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where <b>the</b> Moon caught them, <b>but</b> steadily they grew broader <b>and</b> clearer, until their design could be guessed.
<br>   
<br>   At <b>the</b> top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch <b>of</b> interlacing letters in an Elvish character. Below, though <b>the</b> threads were in places blurred <b>or</b> broken, <b>the</b> outline could be seen <b>of</b> an anvil <b>and</b> a hammer surmounted <b>by</b> a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees, each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door a single star with many rays.
<br>   “There are <b>the</b> emblems <b>of</b> Durin!” cried Gimli.
<br>   “And there is <b>the</b> Tree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Elves!” said Legolas.
<br>   “And <b>the</b> Star <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> F?anor,” said Gandalf. “They are wrought <b>of</b> ithildin that mirrors only starlight <b>and</b> moonlight, <b>and</b> sleeps until <b>it</b> is touched <b>by</b> one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is long since I heard them, <b>and</b> I thought deeply before I could recall them <b>to</b> my mind.”
<br>   “What does <b>the</b> writing say?” asked Frodo, who was trying <b>to</b> decipher <b>the</b> inscription <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arch. “I thought I knew <b>the</b> elf-letters <b>but</b> I cannot read these.”
<br>   “The words are in <b>the</b> elven-tongue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> Middle-earth in <b>the</b> Elder Days,” answered Gandalf. “But they do not say anything <b>of</b> importance <b>to</b> us. They say only: The Doors <b>of</b> Durin, Lord <b>of</b> Moria. Speak, friend, <b>and</b> enter. And underneath small <b>and</b> faint is written: I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor <b>of</b> Hollin drew these signs.”
<br>   “What does <b>it</b> mean <b>by</b> speak, friend, <b>and</b> enter?” asked Merry.
<br>   “That is plain enough,” said Gimli. “If you are a friend, speak <b>the</b> password, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors will open, <b>and</b> you can enter.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Gandalf, “these doors are probably governed <b>by</b> words. Some dwarf-gates will open only at special times, <b>or</b> for particular persons; <b>and</b> some have locks <b>and</b> keys that are still needed when all necessary times <b>and</b> words are known. These doors have <b>no</b> key. In <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Durin they were not secret. They usually stood open <b>and</b> doorwards sat here. But if they were shut, any who knew <b>the</b> opening word could speak <b>it</b> <b>and</b> pass in. At least so <b>it</b> is recorded, is <b>it</b> not, Gimli?”
<br>   “It is,” said <b>the</b> dwarf. “But what <b>the</b> word was is not remembered. Narvi <b>and</b> his craft <b>and</b> all his kindred have vanished from <b>the</b> earth.”
<br>   “But do not you know <b>the</b> word, Gandalf? “asked Boromir in surprise.
<br>   “No! “said <b>the</b> wizard.
<br>   The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent <b>and</b> unmoved.
<br>   “Then what was <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> bringing us <b>to</b> this accursed spot?” cried Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at <b>the</b> dark water. “You told us that you had once passed through <b>the</b> Mines. How could that be, if you did not know how <b>to</b> enter?”
<br>   “The answer <b>to</b> your first question, Boromir,” said <b>the</b> wizard, “is that I do not know <b>the</b> word-yet. But we shall soon see. And,” he added, with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, “you may ask what is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you doubt my tale? Or have you <b>no</b> wits left? I did not enter this way. I came from <b>the</b> East.
<br>   “If you wish <b>to</b> know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. From <b>the</b> inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From <b>the</b> outside nothing will move them save <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> command. They cannot be forced inwards.”
<br>   “What are you going <b>to</b> do then? “asked Pippin, undaunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wizard's bristling brows.
<br>   “Knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doors with your head, Peregrin Took,” said Gandalf. “But if that does not shatter them, <b>and</b> I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will seek for <b>the</b> opening words.
<br>   “I once knew every spell in all <b>the</b> tongues <b>of</b> Elves <b>or</b> Men <b>or</b> Orcs that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score <b>of</b> them without searching in my mind. But only a few trials, I think, will be needed; <b>and</b> I shall not have <b>to</b> call <b>on</b> Gimli for words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret dwarf-tongue that they teach <b>to</b> none. The opening words were Elvish, like <b>the</b> writing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arch: that seems certain.”
<br>   He stepped up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rock again, <b>and</b> lightly touched with his staff <b>the</b> silver star in <b>the</b> middle beneath <b>the</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anvil.
<br>   
<br>Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!
<br>Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!
<br>   
<br>   he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> blank grey stone did not stir.
<br>   Many times he repeated these words in different order, <b>or</b> varied them. Then he tried other spells. one after another, speaking now faster <b>and</b> louder, now soft <b>and</b> slow. Then he spoke many single words <b>of</b> Elvish speech. Nothing happened. The cliff towered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night, <b>the</b> countless stars were kindled, <b>the</b> wind blew cold, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors stood fast.
<br>   Again Gandalf approached <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> lifting up his arms he spoke in tones <b>of</b> command <b>and</b> rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, <b>and</b> struck <b>the</b> rock with his staff. Open, open! he shouted, <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b> with <b>the</b> same command in every language that had ever been spoken in <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> Middle-earth. Then he threw his staff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> sat down in silence.
<br>   At that moment from far off <b>the</b> wind bore <b>to</b> their listening ears <b>the</b> howling <b>of</b> wolves. Bill <b>the</b> pony started in fear, <b>and</b> Sam sprang <b>to</b> his side <b>and</b> whispered softly <b>to</b> him.
<br>   “Do not let him run away! “said Boromir. “It seems that we shall need him still, if <b>the</b> wolves do not find us. How I hate this foul pool! “He stooped <b>and</b> picking up a large stone he cast <b>it</b> far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark water.
<br>   The stone vanished with a soft slap; <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> same instant there was a swish <b>and</b> a bubble. Great rippling rings formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface out beyond where <b>the</b> stone had fallen, <b>and</b> they moved slowly towards <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff.
<br>   “Why did you do that, Boromir? “said Frodo. “I hate this place, too, <b>and</b> I am afraid. I don't know <b>of</b> what: not <b>of</b> wolves, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> dark behind <b>the</b> doors, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> something else. I am afraid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool. Don't disturb <b>it</b>!”
<br>   “l wish we could get away! “said Merry.
<br>   “Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? “said Pippin.
<br>   Gandalf took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> them. He sat with his head bowed, either in despair <b>or</b> in anxious thought. The mournful howling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolves was heard again. The ripples <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water grew <b>and</b> came closer; some were already lapping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore.
<br>   With a suddenness that startled them all <b>the</b> wizard sprang <b>to</b> his feet. He was laughing! “I have <b>it</b>! “he cried. “Of course, <b>of</b> course! Absurdly simple, like most riddles when you see <b>the</b> answer.”
<br>   Picking up his staff he stood before <b>the</b> rock <b>and</b> said in a clear voice: Mellon!
<br>   The star shone out briefly <b>and</b> faded again. Then silently a great doorway was outlined, though not a crack <b>or</b> joint had been visible before. Slowly <b>it</b> divided in <b>the</b> middle <b>and</b> swung outwards inch <b>by</b> inch, until both doors lay back against <b>the</b> wall. Through <b>the</b> opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up; <b>but</b> beyond <b>the</b> lower steps <b>the</b> darkness was deeper than <b>the</b> night. The Company stared in wonder.
<br>   “I was wrong after all,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> Gimli too. Merry, <b>of</b> all people, was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right track. The opening word was inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> archway all <b>the</b> time! The translation should have been: Say “Friend” <b>and</b> enter. I had only <b>to</b> speak <b>the</b> Elvish word for friend <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. Those were happier times. Now let us go!”
<br>   He strode forward <b>and</b> set his foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lowest step. But at that moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ankle, <b>and</b> he fell with a cry. Bill <b>the</b> pony gave a wild neigh <b>of</b> fear, <b>and</b> turned tail <b>and</b> dashed away along <b>the</b> lakeside <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. Sam leaped after him, <b>and</b> then hearing Frodo's cry he ran back again, weeping <b>and</b> cursing. The others swung round <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake seething, as if a host <b>of</b> snakes were swimming up from <b>the</b> southern end.
<br>   Out from <b>the</b> water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; <b>it</b> was pale-green <b>and</b> luminous <b>and</b> wet. Its fingered end had hold <b>of</b> Frodo's foot <b>and</b> was dragging him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water. Sam <b>on</b> his knees was now slashing at <b>it</b> with a knife.
<br>   The arm let go <b>of</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. Twenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, <b>and</b> there was a hideous stench.
<br>   “Into <b>the</b> gateway! Up <b>the</b> stairs! Quick! “shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing them from <b>the</b> horror that seemed <b>to</b> have rooted all <b>but</b> Sam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground where they stood, he drove them forward.
<br>   They were just in time. Sam <b>and</b> Frodo were only a few steps up, <b>and</b> Gandalf had just begun <b>to</b> climb, when <b>the</b> groping tentacles writhed across <b>the</b> narrow shore <b>and</b> fingered <b>the</b> cliff-wall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors. One came wriggling over <b>the</b> threshold, glistening in <b>the</b> starlight. Gandalf turned <b>and</b> paused. If he was considering what word would close <b>the</b> gate again from within, there was <b>no</b> need. Many coiling arms seized <b>the</b> doors <b>on</b> either side, <b>and</b> with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo they slammed, <b>and</b> all light was lost. A noise <b>of</b> rending <b>and</b> crashing came dully through <b>the</b> ponderous stone.
<br>   Sam, clinging <b>to</b> Frodo's arm, collapsed <b>on</b> a step in <b>the</b> black darkness. “Poor old Bill! “he said in a choking voice. “Poor old Bill! Wolves <b>and</b> snakes! But <b>the</b> snakes were too much for him. I had <b>to</b> choose, Mr. Frodo. I had <b>to</b> come with you.”
<br>   They heard Gandalf go back down <b>the</b> steps <b>and</b> thrust his staff against <b>the</b> doors. There was a quiver in <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stairs trembled, .<b>but</b> <b>the</b> doors did not open. “Well, well! “said <b>the</b> wizard. “The passage is blocked behind us now <b>and</b> there is only one way out—<b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. I fear from <b>the</b> sounds that boulders have been piled up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees uprooted <b>and</b> thrown across <b>the</b> gate. I am sorry; for <b>the</b> trees were beautiful, <b>and</b> had stood so long.”
<br>   “I felt that something horrible was near from <b>the</b> moment that my foot first touched <b>the</b> water,” said Frodo. “What was <b>the</b> thing, <b>or</b> were there many <b>of</b> them?”
<br>   “I do not know,” answered Gandalf, “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> arms were all guided <b>by</b> one purpose. Something has crept, <b>or</b> has been driven out <b>of</b> dark waters under <b>the</b> mountains. There are older <b>and</b> fouler things than Orcs in <b>the</b> deep places <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.” He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever <b>it</b> was that dwelt in <b>the</b> lake, <b>it</b> had seized <b>on</b> Frodo first among all <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   Boromir muttered under his breath, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> echoing stone magnified <b>the</b> sound <b>to</b> a hoarse whisper that all could hear: “In <b>the</b> deep places <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us now in this deadly dark?”
<br>   “I will,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!”
<br>   As <b>the</b> wizard passed <b>on</b> ahead up <b>the</b> great steps, he held his staff aloft, <b>and</b> from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was sound <b>and</b> undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad <b>and</b> shallow; <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark.
<br>   “Let us sit <b>and</b> rest <b>and</b> have something <b>to</b> eat, here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> landing, since we can't find a dining-room! “said Frodo. He had begun <b>to</b> shake off <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clutching arm, <b>and</b> suddenly he felt extremely hungry.
<br>   The proposal was welcomed <b>by</b> all; <b>and</b> they sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper steps, dim figures in <b>the</b> gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miruvor <b>of</b> Rivendell.
<br>   “It will not last much longer, I am afraid,” he said; “<b>but</b> I think we need <b>it</b> after that horror at <b>the</b> gate. And unless we have great luck, we shall need all that is left before we see <b>the</b> other side! Go carefully with <b>the</b> water, too! There are many streams <b>and</b> wells in <b>the</b> Mines, <b>but</b> they should not be touched. We may not have a chance <b>of</b> filling our skins <b>and</b> bottles till we come down <b>into</b> Dimrill Dale.”
<br>   “How long is that going <b>to</b> take us? “asked Frodo.
<br>   “I cannot say,” answered Gandalf. “It depends <b>on</b> many chances. But going straight, without mishap <b>or</b> losing our way, we shall take three <b>or</b> four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door <b>to</b> East-gate in a direct line, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road may wind much.”
<br>   After only a brief rest they started <b>on</b> their way again. All were eager <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> journey over as quickly as possible, <b>and</b> were willing, tired as they were, <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> which just showed <b>the</b> ground before his feet; in his right he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in <b>the</b> dim light as he turned his head from side <b>to</b> side. Behind <b>the</b> dwarf walked Frodo, <b>and</b> he had drawn <b>the</b> short sword, Sting. No gleam came from <b>the</b> blades <b>of</b> Sting <b>or</b> <b>of</b> Glamdring; <b>and</b> that was some comfort, for being <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Elvish smiths in <b>the</b> Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, <b>and</b> after him Legolas, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young hobbits, <b>and</b> Boromir. In <b>the</b> dark at <b>the</b> rear, grim <b>and</b> silent, walked Aragorn.
<br>   The passage twisted round a few turns, <b>and</b> then began <b>to</b> descend. It went steadily down for a long while before <b>it</b> became level once again. The air grew hot <b>and</b> stifling, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was not foul, <b>and</b> at times they felt currents <b>of</b> cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings in <b>the</b> walls. There were many <b>of</b> these. In <b>the</b> pale ray <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wizard's staff, Frodo caught glimpses <b>of</b> stairs <b>and</b> arches <b>and</b> <b>of</b> other passages <b>and</b> tunnels, sloping up, <b>or</b> running steeply down, <b>or</b> opening blankly dark <b>on</b> either side. It was bewildering beyond hope <b>of</b> remembering.
<br>   Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except <b>by</b> his stout courage. At least he was not, as were most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others, troubled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mere darkness in itself. Often <b>the</b> wizard consulted him at points where <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> way was doubtful; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was always Gandalf who had <b>the</b> final word. The Mines <b>of</b> Moria were vast <b>and</b> intricate beyond <b>the</b> imagination <b>of</b> Gimli, Gl?in's son, dwarf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf <b>the</b> far-off memories <b>of</b> a journey long before were now <b>of</b> little help, <b>but</b> even in <b>the</b> gloom <b>and</b> despite all windings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road he knew whither he wished <b>to</b> go, <b>and</b> he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.
<br>   “Do not be afraid! “said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, <b>and</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> Gimli were whispering together; <b>the</b> others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously. “Do not be afraid! I have been with him <b>on</b> many a journey, if never <b>on</b> one so dark; <b>and</b> there are tales <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>of</b> greater deeds <b>of</b> his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if there is any path <b>to</b> find. He has led us in here against our fears, <b>but</b> he will lead us out again, at whatever cost <b>to</b> himself. He is surer <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> way home in a blind night than <b>the</b> cats <b>of</b> Queen Ber?thiel.”
<br>   It was well for <b>the</b> Company that they had such a guide. They had <b>no</b> fuel nor any means <b>of</b> making torches; in <b>the</b> desperate scramble at <b>the</b> doors many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have come <b>to</b> grief. There were not only many roads <b>to</b> choose from, there were also in many places holes <b>and</b> pitfalls, <b>and</b> dark wells beside <b>the</b> path in which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures <b>and</b> chasms in <b>the</b> walls <b>and</b> floor, <b>and</b> every now <b>and</b> then a crack would open right before their feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was long before Pippin could summon enough courage <b>to</b> leap over <b>the</b> dreadful gap. The noise <b>of</b> churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was turning in <b>the</b> depths.
<br>   “Rope! “muttered Sam. “I knew I'd want <b>it</b>, if I hadn't got <b>it</b>!”
<br>   As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. Already they seemed <b>to</b> have been tramping <b>on</b>, <b>on</b>, endlessly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountains” roots. They were more than weary, <b>and</b> yet there seemed <b>no</b> comfort in <b>the</b> thought <b>of</b> halting anywhere. Frodo's spirits had risen for a while after his escape, <b>and</b> after food <b>and</b> a draught <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cordial; <b>but</b> now a deep uneasiness, growing <b>to</b> dread, crept over him again. Though he had been healed in Rivendell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been without effect. His senses were sharper <b>and</b> more aware <b>of</b> things that could not be seen. One sign <b>of</b> change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in <b>the</b> dark than any <b>of</b> his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he was in any case <b>the</b> bearer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring: <b>it</b> hung upon its chain against his breast, <b>and</b> at whiles <b>it</b> seemed a heavy weight. He felt <b>the</b> certainty <b>of</b> evil ahead <b>and</b> <b>of</b> evil following; <b>but</b> he said nothing. He gripped tighter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his sword <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> doggedly.
<br>   The Company behind him spoke seldom, <b>and</b> then only in hurried whispers. There was <b>no</b> sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> their own feet; <b>the</b> dull stump <b>of</b> Gimli's dwarf-boots; <b>the</b> heavy tread <b>of</b> Boromir; <b>the</b> light step <b>of</b> Legolas; <b>the</b> soft, scarce-heard patter <b>of</b> hobbit-feet; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> rear <b>the</b> slow firm footfalls <b>of</b> Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless <b>it</b> were occasionally a faint trickle <b>and</b> drip <b>of</b> unseen water. Yet Frodo began <b>to</b> hear, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> imagine that he heard, something else: like <b>the</b> faint fall <b>of</b> soft bare feet. It was never loud enough, <b>or</b> near enough, for him <b>to</b> feel certain that he heard <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> once <b>it</b> had started <b>it</b> never stopped, while <b>the</b> Company was moving. But <b>it</b> was not an echo, for when they halted <b>it</b> pattered <b>on</b> for a little all <b>by</b> itself, <b>and</b> then grew still.
<br>   It was after nightfall when they had entered <b>the</b> Mines. They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came <b>to</b> his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening <b>into</b> three passages: all led in <b>the</b> same general direction, eastwards; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> left-hand passage plunged down, while <b>the</b> right-hand climbed up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> middle way seemed <b>to</b> run <b>on</b>, smooth <b>and</b> level <b>but</b> very narrow.
<br>   “I have <b>no</b> memory <b>of</b> this place at all! “said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under <b>the</b> arch. He held up his staff in <b>the</b> hope <b>of</b> finding some marks <b>or</b> inscription that might help his choice; <b>but</b> nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind was <b>to</b> be seen. “I am too weary <b>to</b> decide,” he said, shaking his head. “And I expect that you are all as weary as I am, <b>or</b> wearier. We had better halt here for what is left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night. You know what I mean! In here <b>it</b> is ever dark; <b>but</b> outside <b>the</b> late Moon is riding westward <b>and</b> <b>the</b> middle-night has passed.”
<br>   “Poor old Bill! “said Sam. “I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves haven't got him yet.”
<br>   To <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great arch they found a stone door: <b>it</b> was half closed, <b>but</b> swung back easily <b>to</b> a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed <b>to</b> lie a wide chamber cut in <b>the</b> rock.
<br>   “Steady! Steady! “cried Gandalf as Merry <b>and</b> Pippin pushed forward, glad <b>to</b> find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling <b>of</b> shelter than in <b>the</b> open passage. “Steady! You do not know what is inside yet. I will go first.”
<br>   He went in cautiously, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others filed behind. “There! “he said, pointing with his staff <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor. Before his feet they saw a large round hole like <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> a well. Broken <b>and</b> rusty chains lay at <b>the</b> edge <b>and</b> trailed down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> black pit. Fragments <b>of</b> stone lay near.
<br>   “One <b>of</b> you might have fallen in <b>and</b> still be wondering when you were going <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> bottom,” said Aragorn <b>to</b> Merry. “Let <b>the</b> guide go first while you have one.”
<br>   “This seems <b>to</b> have been a guardroom, made for <b>the</b> watching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three passages,” said Gimli. “That hole was plainly a well for <b>the</b> guards” use, covered with a stone lid. But <b>the</b> lid is broken, <b>and</b> we must all take care in <b>the</b> dark.”
<br>   Pippin felt curiously attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> well. While <b>the</b> others were unrolling blankets <b>and</b> making beds against <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber, as far as possible from <b>the</b> hole in <b>the</b> floor, he crept <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>and</b> peered over. A chill air seemed <b>to</b> strike his face, rising from invisible depths. Moved <b>by</b> a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, <b>and</b> let <b>it</b> drop. He felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below, as if <b>the</b> stone had fallen <b>into</b> deep water in some cavernous place, there came a plunk, very distant, <b>but</b> magnified <b>and</b> repeated in <b>the</b> hollow shaft.
<br>   “What's that? “cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed what he had done; <b>but</b> he was angry, <b>and</b> Pippin could see his eye glinting. “Fool <b>of</b> a Took! “he growled. “This is a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, <b>and</b> then you will be <b>no</b> further nuisance. Now be quiet!”
<br>   Nothing more was heard for several minutes; <b>but</b> then there came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> echoes had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They sounded disquietingly like signals <b>of</b> some sort; <b>but</b> after a while <b>the</b> knocking died away <b>and</b> was not heard again.
<br>   “That was <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> a hammer, <b>or</b> I have never heard one,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Yes,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> I do not like <b>it</b>. It may have nothing <b>to</b> do with Peregrin's foolish stone; <b>but</b> probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can go <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first watch, as a reward,” he growled, as he rolled himself in a blanket.
<br>   Pippin sat miserably <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door in <b>the</b> pitch dark; <b>but</b> he kept <b>on</b> turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well. He wished he could cover <b>the</b> hole, if only with a blanket, <b>but</b> he dared not move <b>or</b> go near <b>it</b>, even though Gandalf seemed <b>to</b> be asleep.
<br>   Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still <b>and</b> silent. He was deep in thought, trying <b>to</b> recall every memory <b>of</b> his former journey in <b>the</b> Mines, <b>and</b> considering anxiously <b>the</b> next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up <b>and</b> came over <b>to</b> Pippin.
<br>   “Get <b>into</b> a corner <b>and</b> have a sleep, my lad,” he said in a kindly tone. “You want <b>to</b> sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do <b>the</b> watching.”
<br>   “I know what is <b>the</b> matter with me,” he muttered, as he sat down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door. “I need smoke! I have not tasted <b>it</b> since <b>the</b> morning before <b>the</b> snowstorm.”
<br>   The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old wizard huddled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> puff <b>of</b> smoke.
<br>   It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat <b>and</b> watched all alone for about six hours, <b>and</b> had let <b>the</b> others rest. “And in <b>the</b> watches I have made up my mind,” he said. “I do not like <b>the</b> feel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle way; <b>and</b> I do not like <b>the</b> smell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left-hand way: there is foul air down there, <b>or</b> I am <b>no</b> guide. I shall take <b>the</b> right-hand passage. It is time we began <b>to</b> climb up again.”
<br>   For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched <b>on</b>; <b>and</b> they met <b>no</b> danger, <b>and</b> heard nothing, <b>and</b> saw nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> faint gleam <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wizard's light, bobbing like a will-o'-<b>the</b>-wisp in front <b>of</b> them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they could judge <b>it</b> went in great mounting curves, <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> rose <b>it</b> grew loftier <b>and</b> wider. There were now <b>no</b> openings <b>to</b> other galleries <b>or</b> tunnels <b>on</b> either side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> floor was level <b>and</b> sound, without pits <b>or</b> cracks. Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; <b>and</b> they went forward quicker than they had done <b>on</b> their first march.
<br>   In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles <b>or</b> more. As <b>the</b> road climbed upwards` Frodo's spirits rose a little; <b>but</b> he still felt oppressed, <b>and</b> still at times he heard, <b>or</b> thought he heard, away behind <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> beyond <b>the</b> fall <b>and</b> patter <b>of</b> their feet, a following footstep that was not an echo.
<br>   They had marched as far as <b>the</b> hobbits could endure without a rest, <b>and</b> all were thinking <b>of</b> a place where they could sleep, when suddenly <b>the</b> walls <b>to</b> right <b>and</b> left vanished. They seemed <b>to</b> have passed through some arched doorway <b>into</b> a black <b>and</b> empty space. There was a great draught <b>of</b> warmer air behind them, <b>and</b> before them <b>the</b> darkness was cold <b>on</b> their faces. They halted <b>and</b> crowded anxiously together.
<br>   Gandalf seemed pleased. “I chose <b>the</b> right way,” he said. “At last we are coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> habitable parts, <b>and</b> I guess that we are not far now from <b>the</b> eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than <b>the</b> Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken. From <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air we must be in a wide hall. I will now risk a little real light.”
<br>   He raised his staff, <b>and</b> for a brief instant there was blaze like a flash <b>of</b> lightning. Great shadows sprang up <b>and</b> fled, <b>and</b> for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld <b>by</b> many mighty pillars hewn <b>of</b> stone. Before them <b>and</b> <b>on</b> either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black walls, polished <b>and</b> smooth as glass, flashed <b>and</b> glittered. Three other entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, <b>and</b> one <b>on</b> either side. Then <b>the</b> light went out.
<br>   “That is all that I shall venture <b>on</b> for <b>the</b> present,” said Gandalf. “There used <b>to</b> be great windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain-side, <b>and</b> shafts leading out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light in <b>the</b> upper reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mines. I think we have reached them now, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is night outside again, <b>and</b> we cannot tell until morning. If I am right, tomorrow we may actually see <b>the</b> morning peeping in. But in <b>the</b> meanwhile we had better go <b>no</b> further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have gone well so far, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> greater part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark road is over. But we are not through yet, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is a long way down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gates that open <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world.”
<br>   The Company spent that night in <b>the</b> great cavernous hall, huddled close together in a corner <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> draught: there seemed <b>to</b> be a steady inflow <b>of</b> chill air through <b>the</b> eastern archway. All about them as they lay hung <b>the</b> darkness, hollow <b>and</b> immense, <b>and</b> they were oppressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loneliness <b>and</b> vastness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dolven halls <b>and</b> endlessly branching stairs <b>and</b> passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits fell altogether short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual dread <b>and</b> wonder <b>of</b> Moria.
<br>   “There must have been a mighty crowd <b>of</b> dwarves here at one time “said Sam; “<b>and</b> every one <b>of</b> them busier than badgers for five hundred years <b>to</b> make all this, <b>and</b> most in hard rock too! What did they do <b>it</b> all for? They didn't live in these darksome holes surely?”
<br>   “These are not holes,” said Gimli. “This is <b>the</b> great realm <b>and</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarrowdelf. And <b>of</b> old <b>it</b> was not darksome, <b>but</b> full <b>of</b> light <b>and</b> splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.”
<br>   He rose <b>and</b> standing in <b>the</b> dark he began <b>to</b> chant in a deep voice, while <b>the</b> echoes ran away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof.
<br>   
<br>The world was young, <b>the</b> mountains green,
<br>No stain yet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon was seen,
<br>No words were laid <b>on</b> stream <b>or</b> stone
<br>When Durin woke <b>and</b> walked alone.
<br>He named <b>the</b> nameless hills <b>and</b> dells;
<br>He drank from yet untasted wells;
<br>He stooped <b>and</b> looked in Mirrormere,
<br>And saw a crown <b>of</b> stars appear,
<br>As gems upon a silver thread,
<br>Above <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> his head.
<br>
<br>The world was fair, <b>the</b> mountains tall,
<br>In Elder Days before <b>the</b> fall
<br>Of mighty kings in Nargothrond
<br>And Gondolin, who now beyond
<br>The Western Seas have passed away:
<br>The world was fair in Durin's Day.
<br>
<br>A king he was <b>on</b> carven throne
<br>In many-pillared halls <b>of</b> stone
<br>With golden roof <b>and</b> silver floor,
<br>And runes <b>of</b> power upon <b>the</b> door.
<br>The light <b>of</b> sun <b>and</b> star <b>and</b> moon
<br>In shining lamps <b>of</b> crystal hewn
<br>Undimmed <b>by</b> cloud <b>or</b> shade <b>of</b> night
<br>There shone for ever fair <b>and</b> bright.
<br>
<br>There hammer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anvil smote,
<br>There chisel clove, <b>and</b> graver wrote;
<br>There forged was blade, <b>and</b> bound was hilt;
<br>The delver mined, <b>the</b> mason built.
<br>There beryl, pearl, <b>and</b> opal pale,
<br>And metal wrought like fishes” mail,
<br>Buckler <b>and</b> corslet, axe <b>and</b> sword,
<br>And shining spears were laid in hoard.
<br>
<br>Unwearied then were Durin's folk
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> mountains music woke:
<br>The harpers harped, <b>the</b> minstrels sang,
<br>And at <b>the</b> gates <b>the</b> trumpets rang.
<br>
<br>The world is grey, <b>the</b> mountains old,
<br>The forge's fire is ashen-cold
<br>No harp is wrung, <b>no</b> hammer falls:
<br>The darkness dwells in Durin's halls
<br>The shadow lies upon his tomb
<br>In Moria, in Khazad-d?m.
<br>But still <b>the</b> sunken stars appear
<br>In dark <b>and</b> windless Mirrormere;
<br>There lies his crown in water deep,
<br>Till Durin wakes again from sleep.
<br>   
<br>   “I like that! “said Sam. “I should like <b>to</b> learn <b>it</b>. In Moria, in Khazad-d?m! But <b>it</b> makes <b>the</b> darkness seem heavier, thinking <b>of</b> all those lamps. Are there piles <b>of</b> jewels <b>and</b> gold lying about here still?”
<br>   Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say <b>no</b> more.
<br>   “Piles <b>of</b> jewels? “said Gandalf. “No. The Orcs have often plundered Moria; there is nothing left in <b>the</b> upper halls. And since <b>the</b> dwarves fled, <b>no</b> one dares <b>to</b> seek <b>the</b> shafts <b>and</b> treasuries down in <b>the</b> deep places: they are drowned in water—<b>or</b> in a shadow <b>of</b> fear.”
<br>   “Then what do <b>the</b> dwarves want <b>to</b> come back for? “asked Sam.
<br>   “For mithril,” answered Gandalf. “The wealth <b>of</b> Moria was not in gold <b>and</b> jewels, <b>the</b> toys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things they found here, <b>it</b> is true, especially iron; <b>but</b> they did not need <b>to</b> delve for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For here alone in <b>the</b> world was found Moria-silver, <b>or</b> true-silver as some have called <b>it</b>: mithril is <b>the</b> Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times that <b>of</b> gold, <b>and</b> now <b>it</b> is beyond price; for little is left above ground, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> Orcs dare not delve here for <b>it</b>. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, <b>and</b> down <b>to</b> darkness. The Dwarves tell <b>no</b> tale; <b>but</b> even as mithril was <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> their wealth, so also <b>it</b> was their destruction: they delved too greedily <b>and</b> too deep, <b>and</b> disturbed that from which they fled, Durin's Bane. Of what they brought <b>to</b> light <b>the</b> Orcs have gathered nearly all, <b>and</b> given <b>it</b> in tribute <b>to</b> Sauron, who covets <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Mithril! All folk desired <b>it</b>. It could be beaten like copper, <b>and</b> polished like glass; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves could make <b>of</b> <b>it</b> a metal, light <b>and</b> yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like <b>to</b> that <b>of</b> common silver, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> beauty <b>of</b> mithril did not tarnish <b>or</b> grow dim. The Elves dearly loved <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> among many uses they made <b>of</b> <b>it</b> ithildin, starmoon, which you saw upon <b>the</b> doors. Bilbo had a corslet <b>of</b> mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I wonder what has become <b>of</b> <b>it</b>? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.”
<br>   “What? “cried Gimli, startled out <b>of</b> his silence. “A corslet <b>of</b> Moria-silver? That was a kingly gift!”
<br>   “Yes,” said Gandalf. “I never told him, <b>but</b> its worth was greater than <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole Shire <b>and</b> everything in <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Frodo said nothing, <b>but</b> he put his hand under his tunic <b>and</b> touched <b>the</b> rings <b>of</b> his mail-shirt. He felt staggered <b>to</b> think that he had been walking about with <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt <b>no</b> doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts had been carried away from <b>the</b> dark Mines, <b>to</b> Rivendell, <b>to</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> Bag End in <b>the</b> days while Bilbo was still there. He wished with all his heart that he was back there, <b>and</b> in those days, mowing <b>the</b> lawn, <b>or</b> pottering among <b>the</b> flowers, <b>and</b> that he had never heard <b>of</b> Moria, <b>or</b> mithril—<b>or</b> <b>the</b> Ring.
<br>   A deep silence fell. One <b>by</b> one <b>the</b> others fell asleep. Frodo was <b>on</b> guard. As if <b>it</b> were a breath that came in through unseen doors out <b>of</b> deep places, dread came over him. His hands were cold <b>and</b> his brow damp. He listened. All his mind was given <b>to</b> listening <b>and</b> nothing else for two slow hours; <b>but</b> he heard <b>no</b> sound, not even <b>the</b> imagined echo <b>of</b> a footfall.
<br>   His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that <b>the</b> western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points <b>of</b> light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. “I must have nearly fallen asleep <b>on</b> guard,” he thought. “I was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a dream.” He stood up <b>and</b> rubbed his eyes, <b>and</b> remained standing, peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark, until he was relieved <b>by</b> Legolas.
<br>   When he lay down he quickly went <b>to</b> sleep, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that <b>the</b> dream went <b>on</b>: he heard whispers, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> two pale points <b>of</b> light approaching, slowly. He woke <b>and</b> found that <b>the</b> others were speaking softly near him, <b>and</b> that a dim light was falling <b>on</b> his face. High up above <b>the</b> eastern archway through a shaft near <b>the</b> roof came a long pale gleam; <b>and</b> across <b>the</b> hall through <b>the</b> northern arch light also glimmered faint <b>and</b> distantly.
<br>   Frodo sat up. “Good morning! “said Gandalf: “For morning <b>it</b> is again at last. I was right, you see. We are high up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> Moria. Before today is over we ought <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Great Gates <b>and</b> see <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> Mirrormere lying in <b>the</b> Dimrill Dale before us.”
<br>   “I shall be glad,” said Gimli. “I have looked <b>on</b> Moria, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is very great, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> has become dark <b>and</b> dreadful; <b>and</b> we have found <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> my kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.”
<br>   After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> again at once. “We are tired, <b>but</b> we shall rest better when we are outside,” he said. “I think that none <b>of</b> us will wish <b>to</b> spend another night in Moria.”
<br>   “No indeed! “said Boromir. “Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch?”
<br>   “Maybe,” said Gandalf. “But I do not know yet exactly where we are. Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Gates; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may not be easy <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> right road down <b>to</b> them. The eastern arch will probably prove <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> way that we must take; <b>but</b> before we make up our minds we ought <b>to</b> look about us. Let us go towards that light in <b>the</b> north door. If we could find a window <b>it</b> would help, <b>but</b> I fear that <b>the</b> light comes only down deep shafts.”
<br>   Following his lead <b>the</b> Company passed under <b>the</b> northern arch. They found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along <b>it</b> <b>the</b> glimmer grew stronger, <b>and</b> they saw that <b>it</b> came through a doorway <b>on</b> their right. It was high <b>and</b> flat-topped, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone door was still upon its hinges, standing half open. Beyond <b>it</b> was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> their eyes, after so long a time in <b>the</b> dark, <b>it</b> seemed dazzlingly bright, <b>and</b> they blinked as they entered.
<br>   Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon <b>the</b> floor, <b>and</b> stumbled among things lying in <b>the</b> doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. The chamber was lit <b>by</b> a wide shaft high in <b>the</b> further eastern wall; <b>it</b> slanted upwards <b>and</b>, far above, a small square patch <b>of</b> blue sky could be seen. The light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaft fell directly <b>on</b> a table in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a great slab <b>of</b> white stone.
<br>   “It looks like a tomb,” muttered Frodo, <b>and</b> bent forwards with a curious sense <b>of</b> foreboding, <b>to</b> look more closely at <b>it</b>. Gandalf came quickly <b>to</b> his side. On <b>the</b> slab runes were deeply graven:
<br>   
<br>   
<br>   “These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used <b>of</b> old in Moria,” said Gandalf. “Here is written in <b>the</b> tongues <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> Dwarves:
<br>   
<br>balin son <b>of</b> fundin
<br>lord <b>of</b> moria.”
<br>   
<br>   “He is dead then,” said Frodo. “I feared <b>it</b> was so.” Gimli cast his hood over his face.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-D?M
<br>
<br>   The Company <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring stood silent beside <b>the</b> tomb <b>of</b> Balin. Frodo thought <b>of</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> his long friendship with <b>the</b> dwarf, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Balin's visit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in <b>the</b> mountains <b>it</b> seemed a thousand years ago <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.
<br>   At length they stirred <b>and</b> looked up, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> search for anything that would give them tidings <b>of</b> Balin's fate, <b>or</b> show what had become <b>of</b> his folk. There was another smaller door <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber, under <b>the</b> shaft. By both <b>the</b> doors they could now see that many bones were lying, <b>and</b> among them were broken swords <b>and</b> axe-heads, <b>and</b> cloven shields <b>and</b> helms. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.
<br>   There were many recesses cut in <b>the</b> rock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls, <b>and</b> in them were large iron-bound chests <b>of</b> wood. All had been broken <b>and</b> plundered; <b>but</b> beside <b>the</b> shattered lid <b>of</b> one there lay <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> a book. It had been slashed <b>and</b> stabbed <b>and</b> partly burned, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was so stained with black <b>and</b> other dark marks like old blood that little <b>of</b> <b>it</b> could be read. Gandalf lifted <b>it</b> carefully, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> leaves crackled <b>and</b> broke as he laid <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slab. He pored over <b>it</b> for some time without speaking. Frodo <b>and</b> Gimli standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned <b>the</b> leaves, that they were written <b>by</b> many different hands, in runes, both <b>of</b> Moria <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Dale, <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there in Elvish script.
<br>   At last Gandalf looked up. “It seems <b>to</b> be a record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortunes <b>of</b> Balin's folk,” he said. “I guess that <b>it</b> began with their coming <b>to</b> Dimrill Dale nigh <b>on</b> thirty years ago: <b>the</b> pages seem <b>to</b> have numbers referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> years after their arrival. The top page is marked one—three, so at least two are missing from <b>the</b> beginning. Listen <b>to</b> this!
<br>   “We drove out orcs from <b>the</b> great gate <b>and</b> guard—I think; <b>the</b> next word is blurred <b>and</b> burned; probably room—we slew many in <b>the</b> bright—I think—sun in <b>the</b> dale. Fl?i was killed <b>by</b> an arrow. He slew <b>the</b> great. Then there is a blur followed <b>by</b> Fl?i under grass near Mirror mere. The next line <b>or</b> two I cannot read. Then comes We have taken <b>the</b> twentyfirst hall <b>of</b> North end <b>to</b> dwell in. There is I cannot read what. A shaft is mentioned. Then Balin has set up his seat in <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul.”
<br>   “The Chamber <b>of</b> Records,” said Gimli. “I guess that is where we now stand.”
<br>   “Well, I can read <b>no</b> more for a long way,” said Gandalf, “except <b>the</b> word gold, <b>and</b> Durin's Axe <b>and</b> something helm. Then Balin is now lord <b>of</b> Moria. That seems <b>to</b> end a chapter. After some stars another hand begins, <b>and</b> I can see we found truesilver, <b>and</b> later <b>the</b> word wellforged <b>and</b> then something, I have <b>it</b>! mithril; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last two lines ?in <b>to</b> seek for <b>the</b> upper armouries <b>of</b> Third Deep, something go westwards, a blur, <b>to</b> Hollin gate.”
<br>   Gandalf paused <b>and</b> set a few leaves aside. “There are several pages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sort, rather hastily written <b>and</b> much damaged, he said; “<b>but</b> I can make little <b>of</b> them in this light. Now there must be a number <b>of</b> leaves missing, because they begin <b>to</b> be numbered five, <b>the</b> fifth year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut <b>and</b> stained; I cannot read them. We might do better in <b>the</b> sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a large bold hand using an Elvish script.”
<br>   “That would be Ori's hand,” said Gimli, looking over <b>the</b> wizard's arm. “He could write well <b>and</b> speedily, <b>and</b> often used <b>the</b> Elvish characters.”
<br>   “I fear he had ill tidings <b>to</b> record in a fair hand,” said Gandalf. “The first clear word is sorrow, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line is lost, unless <b>it</b> ends in estre. Yes, <b>it</b> must be yestre followed <b>by</b> day being <b>the</b> tenth <b>of</b> novembre Balin lord <b>of</b> Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone <b>to</b> look in Mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew <b>the</b> orc, hut many more ... up from east up <b>the</b> Silverlode. The remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out, <b>but</b> I think I can read we have barred <b>the</b> gates, <b>and</b> then can hold them long if, <b>and</b> then perhaps horrible <b>and</b> suffer. Poor Balin! He seems <b>to</b> have kept <b>the</b> title that he took for less than five years. I wonder what happened afterwards; <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> puzzle out <b>the</b> last few pages. Here is <b>the</b> last page <b>of</b> all.” He paused <b>and</b> sighed.
<br>   “It is grim reading,” he said. “I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken <b>the</b> Bridge <b>and</b> second hall. Fr?r <b>and</b> L?ni <b>and</b> N?li fell there. Then there are four lines smeared so that I can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run <b>the</b> pool is up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall at Westgate. The Watcher in <b>the</b> Water took ?in. We cannot get out. The end comes, <b>and</b> then drums, drums in <b>the</b> deep. I wonder what that means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl <b>of</b> elf-letters: they are coming. There is nothing more.” Gandalf paused <b>and</b> stood in silent thought.
<br>   A sudden dread <b>and</b> a horror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Company. “We cannot get out,” muttered Gimli. “It was well for us that <b>the</b> pool had sunk a little, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> Watcher was sleeping down at <b>the</b> southern end.”
<br>   Gandalf raised his head <b>and</b> looked round. “They seem <b>to</b> have made a last stand <b>by</b> both doors,” he said; “<b>but</b> there were not many left <b>by</b> that time. So ended <b>the</b> attempt <b>to</b> retake Moria! It was valiant <b>but</b> foolish. The time is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell <b>to</b> Balin son <b>of</b> Fundin. Here he must lie in <b>the</b> halls <b>of</b> his fathers. We will take this book, <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Mazarbul, <b>and</b> look at <b>it</b> more closely later. You had better keep <b>it</b>, Gimli, <b>and</b> take <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> D?in, if you get a chance. It will interest him, though <b>it</b> will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The morning is passing.”
<br>   “Which way shall we go? “asked Boromir.
<br>   “Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall,” answered Gandalf. “But our visit <b>to</b> this room has not been in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hall must be <b>the</b> twenty-first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North-end. Therefore we should leave <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eastern arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> bear right <b>and</b> south, <b>and</b> go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Seventh Level, that is six above <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates. Come now! Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall!”
<br>   Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling Boom that seemed <b>to</b> come from depths far below, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> tremble in <b>the</b> stone at their feet. They sprang towards <b>the</b> door in alarm. Doom, doom <b>it</b> rolled again, as if huge hands were turning <b>the</b> very caverns <b>of</b> Moria <b>into</b> a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown in <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> answering horns <b>and</b> harsh cries were heard further off. There was a hurrying sound <b>of</b> many feet.
<br>   “They are coming! “cried Legolas.
<br>   “We cannot get out,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Trapped! “cried Gandalf. “Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just as they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what ——”
<br>   Doom, doom came <b>the</b> drum-beat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> walls shook.
<br>   “Slam <b>the</b> doors <b>and</b> wedge them! “shouted Aragorn. “And keep your packs <b>on</b> as long as you can: we may get a chance <b>to</b> cut our way out yet.”
<br>   “No! “said Gandalf. “We must not get shut in. Keep <b>the</b> east door ajar! We will go that way, if we get a chance.”
<br>   Another harsh horn-call <b>and</b> shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming down <b>the</b> corridor. There was a ring <b>and</b> clatter as <b>the</b> Company drew their swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, <b>and</b> Sting glinted at <b>the</b> edges. Boromir set his shoulder against <b>the</b> western door.
<br>   “Wait a moment! Do not close <b>it</b> yet! “said Gandalf. He sprang forward <b>to</b> Boromir's side <b>and</b> drew himself up <b>to</b> his full height.
<br>   “Who comes hither <b>to</b> disturb <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Balin Lord <b>of</b> Moria? “he cried in a loud voice.
<br>   There was a rush <b>of</b> hoarse laughter, like <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> sliding stones <b>into</b> a pit; amid <b>the</b> clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom, boom, doom went <b>the</b> drums in <b>the</b> deep.
<br>   With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before <b>the</b> narrow opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> thrust forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit <b>the</b> chamber <b>and</b> <b>the</b> passage outside. For an instant <b>the</b> wizard looked out. Arrows whined <b>and</b> whistled down <b>the</b> corridor as he sprang back.
<br>   “There are Orcs, very many <b>of</b> them,” he said. “And some are large <b>and</b> evil: black Uruks <b>of</b> Mordor. For <b>the</b> moment they are hanging back, <b>but</b> there is something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, <b>or</b> more than one. There is <b>no</b> hope <b>of</b> escape that way.”
<br>   “And <b>no</b> hope at all, if they come at <b>the</b> other door as well,” said Boromir.
<br>   “There is <b>no</b> sound outside here yet,” said Aragorn, who was standing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eastern door listening. “The passage <b>on</b> this side plunges straight down a stair: <b>it</b> plainly does not lead back towards <b>the</b> hall. But <b>it</b> is <b>no</b> good flying blindly this way with <b>the</b> pursuit just behind. We cannot block <b>the</b> door. Its key is gone <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lock is broken, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> opens inwards. We must do something <b>to</b> delay <b>the</b> enemy first. We will make them fear <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul!” he said grimly feeling <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> his sword, And?ril.
<br>   Heavy feet were heard in <b>the</b> corridor. Boromir flung himself against <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> heaved <b>it</b> <b>to</b>; then he wedged <b>it</b> with broken sword-blades <b>and</b> splinters <b>of</b> wood. The Company retreated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber. But they had <b>no</b> chance <b>to</b> fly yet. There was a blow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door that made <b>it</b> quiver; <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> grind slowly open, driving back <b>the</b> wedges. A huge arm <b>and</b> shoulder, with a dark skin <b>of</b> greenish scales, was thrust through <b>the</b> widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced through below. There was a dead silence outside.
<br>   Boromir leaped forward <b>and</b> hewed at <b>the</b> arm with all his might; <b>but</b> his sword rang, glanced aside, <b>and</b> fell from his shaken hand. The blade was notched.
<br>   Suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart. “The Shire! “he cried, <b>and</b> springing beside Boromir, he stooped, <b>and</b> stabbed with Sting at <b>the</b> hideous foot. There was a bellow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arm. Black drops dripped from <b>the</b> blade <b>and</b> smoked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Boromir hurled himself against <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> slammed <b>it</b> again.
<br>   “One for <b>the</b> Shire! “cried Aragorn. “The hobbit's bite is deep! You have a good blade, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo!”
<br>   There was a crash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door, followed <b>by</b> crash after crash. Rams <b>and</b> hammers were beating against <b>it</b>. It cracked <b>and</b> staggered back, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, <b>but</b> struck <b>the</b> northern wall, <b>and</b> fell harmlessly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. There was a horn-blast <b>and</b> a rush <b>of</b> feet, <b>and</b> orcs one after another leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber.
<br>   How many there were <b>the</b> Company could not count. The affray was sharp, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> orcs were dismayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fierceness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defence. Legolas shot two through <b>the</b> throat. Gimli hewed <b>the</b> legs from under another that had sprung up <b>on</b> Balin's tomb. Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn slew many. When thirteen had fallen <b>the</b> rest fled shrieking. leaving <b>the</b> defenders unharmed, except for Sam who had a scratch along <b>the</b> scalp. A quick duck had saved him; <b>and</b> he had felled his orc: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step backwards, if he had seen <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Now is <b>the</b> time! “cried Gandalf. “Let us go, before <b>the</b> troll returns!”
<br>   But even as they retreated, <b>and</b> before Pippin <b>and</b> Merry had reached <b>the</b> stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail from head <b>to</b> foot, leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber; behind him his followers clustered in <b>the</b> doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like coals, <b>and</b> his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust <b>of</b> his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's sword <b>and</b> bore him backwards, throwing him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> a striking snake he charged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side, <b>and</b> Frodo was hurled against <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at <b>the</b> spear-shaft, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> broke. But even as <b>the</b> orc flung down <b>the</b> truncheon <b>and</b> swept out his scimitar, And?ril came down upon his helm. There was a flash like flame <b>and</b> <b>the</b> helm burst asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled howling, as Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn sprang at them.
<br>   Doom, doom went <b>the</b> drums in <b>the</b> deep. The great voice rolled out again.
<br>   “Now! “shouted Gandalf. “Now is <b>the</b> last chance. Run for <b>it</b>!”
<br>   Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> stair, pushing Merry <b>and</b> Pippin in front <b>of</b> him. The others followed; <b>but</b> Gimli had <b>to</b> be dragged away <b>by</b> Legolas: in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peril he lingered <b>by</b> Balin's tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled <b>the</b> eastern door <b>to</b>, grinding upon its hinges: <b>it</b> had great iron rings <b>on</b> either side, <b>but</b> could not be fastened.
<br>   “I am all right,” gasped Frodo. “I can walk. Put me down!”
<br>   Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. “I thought you were dead! “he cried.
<br>   “Not yet! “said Gandalf. “But there is time for wonder. Off you go, all <b>of</b> you, down <b>the</b> stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at <b>the</b> bottom, <b>but</b> if I do not come soon, go <b>on</b>! Go quickly <b>and</b> choose paths leading right <b>and</b> downwards.”
<br>   “We cannot leave you <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> door alone! “said Aragorn.
<br>   “Do as I say! “said Gandalf fiercely. “Swords are <b>no</b> more use here. Go!”
<br>   The passage was lit <b>by</b> <b>no</b> shaft <b>and</b> was utterly dark. They groped their way down a long flight <b>of</b> steps, <b>and</b> then looked back; <b>but</b> they could see nothing, except high above them <b>the</b> faint glimmer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wizard's staff. He seemed <b>to</b> be still standing <b>on</b> guard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> closed door. Frodo breathed heavily <b>and</b> leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood peering up <b>the</b> stairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. Frodo thought he could hear <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down <b>the</b> sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed <b>to</b> be trembling. Every now <b>and</b> again <b>the</b> drum-beats throbbed <b>and</b> rolled: doom, doom.
<br>   Suddenly at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stair there was a stab <b>of</b> white light. Then there was a dull rumble <b>and</b> a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly: doom-boom, doom-boom, <b>and</b> then stopped. Gandalf came flying down <b>the</b> steps <b>and</b> fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “Well, well! That's over! “said <b>the</b> wizard struggling <b>to</b> his feet. “I have done all that I could. But I have met my match, <b>and</b> have nearly been destroyed. But don't stand here! Go <b>on</b>! You will have <b>to</b> do without light for a while: I am rather shaken. Go <b>on</b>! Go <b>on</b>! Where are you, Gimli? Come ahead with me! Keep close behind, all <b>of</b> you!”
<br>   They stumbled after him wondering what had happened. Doom, doom went <b>the</b> drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled <b>and</b> far away, <b>but</b> they were following. There was <b>no</b> other sound <b>of</b> pursuit, neither tramp <b>of</b> feet, nor any voice. Gandalf took <b>no</b> turns, right <b>or</b> left, for <b>the</b> passage seemed <b>to</b> be going in <b>the</b> direction that he desired. Every now <b>and</b> again <b>it</b> descended a flight <b>of</b> steps, fifty <b>or</b> more, <b>to</b> a lower level. At <b>the</b> moment that was their chief danger; for in <b>the</b> dark they could not see a descent, until they came <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> put their feet out <b>into</b> emptiness. Gandalf felt <b>the</b> ground with his staff like a blind man.
<br>   At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> an hour they had gone a mile, <b>or</b> maybe a little more, <b>and</b> had descended many flights <b>of</b> stairs. There was still <b>no</b> sound <b>of</b> pursuit. Almost they began <b>to</b> hope that they would escape. At <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh flight Gandalf halted.
<br>   “It is getting hot! “he gasped. “We ought <b>to</b> be down at least <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates now. Soon I think we should look for a left-hand turn <b>to</b> take us east. I hope <b>it</b> is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a moment, even if all <b>the</b> orcs ever spawned are after us.”
<br>   Gimli took his arm <b>and</b> helped him down <b>to</b> a seat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step. “What happened away up there at <b>the</b> door? “he asked. “Did you meet <b>the</b> beater <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drums?”
<br>   “I do not know,” answered Gandalf. “But I found myself suddenly faced <b>by</b> something that I have not met before. I could think <b>of</b> nothing <b>to</b> do <b>but</b> <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> put a shutting-spell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. I know many; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> do things <b>of</b> that kind rightly requires time, <b>and</b> even then <b>the</b> door can be broken <b>by</b> strength.
<br>   “As I stood there I could hear orc-voices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side: at any moment I thought they would burst <b>it</b> open. I could not hear what was said; they seemed <b>to</b> be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was gh?sh; that is “fire". Then something came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber—I felt <b>it</b> through <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> orcs themselves were afraid <b>and</b> fell silent. It laid hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron ring, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> perceived me <b>and</b> my spell.
<br>   “What <b>it</b> was I cannot guess, <b>but</b> I have never felt such a challenge. The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant <b>the</b> door left my control <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> open! I had <b>to</b> speak a word <b>of</b> Command. That proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all <b>the</b> light inside, <b>and</b> I was thrown backwards down <b>the</b> stairs. All <b>the</b> wall gave way, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber as well, I think.
<br>   “I am afraid Balin is buried deep, <b>and</b> maybe something else is buried there too. I cannot say. But at least <b>the</b> passage behind us was completely blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is passing. And now what about you, Frodo? There was not time <b>to</b> say so, <b>but</b> I have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that <b>it</b> was a brave <b>but</b> dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.”
<br>   “What about me? “said Frodo. “I am alive, <b>and</b> whole I think. I am bruised <b>and</b> in pain, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is not too bad.”
<br>   “Well,” said Aragorn, “I can only say that hobbits are made <b>of</b> a stuff so tough that I have never met <b>the</b> like <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Had I known, I would have spoken softer in <b>the</b> Inn at Bree! That spear-thrust would have skewered a wild boar!”
<br>   “Well, <b>it</b> did not skewer me, I am glad <b>to</b> say,” said Frodo; “though I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer <b>and</b> an anvil.” He said <b>no</b> more. He found breathing painful.
<br>   “You take after Bilbo,” said Gandalf. “There is more about you than meets <b>the</b> eye, as I said <b>of</b> him long ago.” Frodo wondered if <b>the</b> remark meant more than <b>it</b> said.
<br>   They now went <b>on</b> again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in <b>the</b> dark. “I think,” he said, “that there is a light ahead. But <b>it</b> is not daylight. It is red. What can <b>it</b> be?”
<br>   “Gh?sh!” muttered Gandalf. “I wonder if that is what they meant: that <b>the</b> lower levels are <b>on</b> fire? Still, we can only go <b>on</b>.”
<br>   Soon <b>the</b> light became unmistakable, <b>and</b> could be seen <b>by</b> all. It was flickering <b>and</b> glowing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls away down <b>the</b> passage before them. They could now see their way: in front <b>the</b> road sloped down swiftly, <b>and</b> some way ahead there stood a low archway; through <b>it</b> <b>the</b> glowing light came. The air became very hot.
<br>   When they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arch Gandalf went through, signing <b>to</b> them <b>to</b> wait. As he stood just beyond <b>the</b> opening they saw his face lit <b>by</b> a red glow. Quickly he stepped back.
<br>   “There is some new devilry here,” he said, “devised for our welcome <b>no</b> doubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached <b>the</b> First Deep, <b>the</b> level immediately below <b>the</b> Gates. This is <b>the</b> Second Hall <b>of</b> Old Moria; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gates are near: away beyond <b>the</b> eastern end, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, not more than a quarter <b>of</b> a mile. Across <b>the</b> Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road through <b>the</b> First Hall, <b>and</b> out! But come <b>and</b> look!”
<br>   They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier <b>and</b> far longer than <b>the</b> one in which they had slept. They were near its eastern end; westward <b>it</b> ran away <b>into</b> darkness. Down <b>the</b> centre stalked a double line <b>of</b> towering pillars. They were carved like boles <b>of</b> mighty trees whose boughs upheld <b>the</b> roof with a branching tracery <b>of</b> stone. Their stems were smooth <b>and</b> black, <b>but</b> a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. Right across <b>the</b> floor, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> two huge pillars a great fissure had opened. Out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> a fierce red light came, <b>and</b> now <b>and</b> again flames licked at <b>the</b> brink <b>and</b> curled about <b>the</b> bases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> columns. Wisps <b>of</b> dark smoke wavered in <b>the</b> hot air.
<br>   “If we had come <b>by</b> <b>the</b> main road down from <b>the</b> upper halls, we should have been trapped here,” said Gandalf. “Let us hope that <b>the</b> fire now lies between us <b>and</b> pursuit. Come! There is <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> lose.”
<br>   Even as he spoke they heard again <b>the</b> pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, doom. Away beyond <b>the</b> shadows at <b>the</b> western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall there came cries <b>and</b> horn-calls. Doom, doom: <b>the</b> pillars seemed <b>to</b> tremble <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flames <b>to</b> quiver.
<br>   “Now for <b>the</b> last race! “said Gandalf. “If <b>the</b> sun is shining outside we may still escape. After me!”
<br>   He turned left <b>and</b> sped across <b>the</b> smooth floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall. The distance was greater than <b>it</b> had looked. As they ran they heard <b>the</b> beat <b>and</b> echo <b>of</b> many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they had been seen. There was a ring <b>and</b> clash <b>of</b> steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo's head.
<br>   Boromir laughed. “They did not expect this,” he said. “The fire has cut them off. We are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side!”
<br>   “Look ahead! “called Gandalf. “The Bridge is near. It is dangerous <b>and</b> narrow.”
<br>   Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>the</b> floor vanished <b>and</b> fell <b>to</b> an unknown depth. The outer door could only be reached <b>by</b> a slender bridge <b>of</b> stone, without kerb <b>or</b> rail, that spanned <b>the</b> chasm with one curving spring <b>of</b> fifty feet. It was an ancient defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves against any enemy that might capture <b>the</b> First Hall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> outer passages. They could only pass across <b>it</b> in single file. At <b>the</b> brink Gandalf halted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others came up in a pack behind.
<br>   “Lead <b>the</b> way, Gimli! “he said. “Pippin <b>and</b> Merry next. Straight <b>on</b> <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> stair beyond <b>the</b> door!”
<br>   Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo <b>and</b> sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf's hat <b>and</b> stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond <b>the</b> fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed <b>to</b> be hundreds <b>of</b> orcs. They brandished spears <b>and</b> scimitars which shone red as blood in <b>the</b> firelight. Doom, doom rolled <b>the</b> drum-beats, growing louder <b>and</b> louder, doom, doom.
<br>   Legolas turned <b>and</b> set an arrow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> string, though <b>it</b> was a long shot for his small bow. He drew, <b>but</b> his hand fell, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrow slipped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. He gave a cry <b>of</b> dismay <b>and</b> fear. Two great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs <b>of</b> stone, <b>and</b> flung them down <b>to</b> serve as gangways over <b>the</b> fire. But <b>it</b> was not <b>the</b> trolls that had filled <b>the</b> Elf with terror. The ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orcs had opened, <b>and</b> they crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What <b>it</b> was could not be seen: <b>it</b> was like a great shadow, in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> which was a dark form, <b>of</b> man-shape maybe, yet greater; <b>and</b> a power <b>and</b> terror seemed <b>to</b> be in <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> go before <b>it</b>.
<br>   It came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light faded as if a cloud had bent over <b>it</b>. Then with a rush <b>it</b> leaped across <b>the</b> fissure. The flames roared up <b>to</b> greet <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> wreathed about <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> a black smoke swirled in <b>the</b> air. Its streaming mane kindled, <b>and</b> blazed behind <b>it</b>. In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue <b>of</b> fire; in its left <b>it</b> held a whip <b>of</b> many thongs.
<br>   “Ai! ai! “wailed Legolas. “A Balrog! A Balrog is come!”
<br>   Gimli stared with wide eyes. “Durin's Bane! “he cried, <b>and</b> letting his axe fall he covered his face.
<br>   “A Balrog,” muttered Gandalf. “Now I understand.” He faltered <b>and</b> leaned heavily <b>on</b> his staff. “What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.”
<br>   The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled <b>and</b> poured over <b>the</b> stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn <b>and</b> blew. Loud <b>the</b> challenge rang <b>and</b> bellowed, like <b>the</b> shout <b>of</b> many throats under <b>the</b> cavernous roof. For a moment <b>the</b> orcs quailed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fiery shadow halted. Then <b>the</b> echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out <b>by</b> a dark wind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enemy advanced again.
<br>   “Over <b>the</b> bridge!” cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. “Fly! This is a foe beyond any <b>of</b> you. I must hold <b>the</b> narrow way. Fly! “Aragorn <b>and</b> Boromir did not heed <b>the</b> command, <b>but</b> still held their ground, side <b>by</b> side, behind Gandalf at <b>the</b> far end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge. The others halted just within <b>the</b> doorway at <b>the</b> hall's end, <b>and</b> turned, unable <b>to</b> leave their leader <b>to</b> face <b>the</b> enemy alone.
<br>   The Balrog reached <b>the</b> bridge. Gandalf stood in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> span, leaning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staff in his left hand, <b>but</b> in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold <b>and</b> white. His enemy halted again, facing him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow about <b>it</b> reached out like two vast wings. It raised <b>the</b> whip, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> thongs whined <b>and</b> cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.
<br>   “You cannot pass,” he said. The orcs stood still, <b>and</b> a dead silence fell. “I am a servant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Secret Fire, wielder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame <b>of</b> Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame <b>of</b> Ud?n. Go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shadow! You cannot pass.”
<br>   The Balrog made <b>no</b> answer. The fire in <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> die, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bridge, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>it</b> drew itself up <b>to</b> a great height, <b>and</b> its wings were spread from wall <b>to</b> wall; <b>but</b> still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in <b>the</b> gloom; he seemed small, <b>and</b> altogether alone: grey <b>and</b> bent, like a wizened tree before <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> a storm.
<br>   From out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow a red sword leaped flaming.
<br>   Glamdring glittered white in answer.
<br>   There was a ringing clash <b>and</b> a stab <b>of</b> white fire. The Balrog fell back <b>and</b> its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge, stepped back a pace, <b>and</b> then again stood still.
<br>   “You cannot pass! “he said.
<br>   With a bound <b>the</b> Balrog leaped full upon <b>the</b> bridge. Its whip whirled <b>and</b> hissed.
<br>   “He cannot stand alone! “cried Aragorn suddenly <b>and</b> ran back along <b>the</b> bridge. “Elendil!” he shouted. “I am with you, Gandalf!”
<br>   “Gondor! “cried Boromir <b>and</b> leaped after him.
<br>   At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, <b>and</b> crying aloud he smote <b>the</b> bridge before him. The staff broke asunder <b>and</b> fell from his hand. A blinding sheet <b>of</b> white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at <b>the</b> Balrog's feet <b>it</b> broke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone upon which <b>it</b> stood crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gulf, while <b>the</b> rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue <b>of</b> rock thrust out <b>into</b> emptiness.
<br>   With a terrible cry <b>the</b> Balrog fell forward, <b>and</b> its shadow plunged down <b>and</b> vanished. But even as <b>it</b> fell <b>it</b> swung its whip, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> thongs lashed <b>and</b> curled about <b>the</b> wizard's knees, dragging him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink. He staggered <b>and</b> fell, grasped vainly at <b>the</b> stone, <b>and</b> slid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> abyss. “Fly, you fools! “he cried, <b>and</b> was gone.
<br>   The fires went out, <b>and</b> blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted with horror staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit. Even as Aragorn <b>and</b> Boromir came flying back, <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge cracked <b>and</b> fell. With a cry Aragorn roused them.
<br>   “Come! I will lead you now! “he called. “We must obey his last command. Follow me!”
<br>   They stumbled wildly up <b>the</b> great stairs beyond <b>the</b> door. Aragorn leading, Boromir at <b>the</b> rear. At <b>the</b> top was a wide echoing passage. Along this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, <b>and</b> then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom <b>the</b> drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now <b>and</b> slow; doom!
<br>   They ran <b>on</b>. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced <b>the</b> roof. They ran swifter. They passed <b>into</b> a hall, bright with daylight from its high windows in <b>the</b> east. They fled across <b>it</b>. Through its huge broken doors they passed, <b>and</b> suddenly before them <b>the</b> Great Gates opened, an arch <b>of</b> blazing light.
<br>   There was a guard <b>of</b> orcs crouching in <b>the</b> shadows behind <b>the</b> great door posts towering <b>on</b> either side, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> gates were shattered <b>and</b> cast down. Aragorn smote <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>the</b> captain that stood in his path, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest fled in terror <b>of</b> his wrath. The Company swept past them <b>and</b> took <b>no</b> heed <b>of</b> them. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates they ran <b>and</b> sprang down <b>the</b> huge <b>and</b> age-worn steps, <b>the</b> threshold <b>of</b> Moria.
<br>   Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under <b>the</b> sky <b>and</b> felt <b>the</b> wind <b>on</b> their faces.
<br>   They did not halt until they were out <b>of</b> bowshot from <b>the</b> walls. Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains lay upon <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> eastwards there was a golden light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land. It was <b>but</b> one hour after noon. The sun was shining; <b>the</b> clouds were white <b>and</b> high.
<br>   They looked back. Dark yawned <b>the</b> archway <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates under <b>the</b> mountain-shadow. Faint <b>and</b> far beneath <b>the</b> earth rolled <b>the</b> slow drum-beats: doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was <b>to</b> be seen; <b>the</b> dale all around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, <b>and</b> they wept long: some standing <b>and</b> silent, some cast upon <b>the</b> ground. Doom, doom. The drum-beats faded.
<br>

<br>Chapter 6
<br>LOTHL?RIEN
<br>
<br>   “Alas! I Fear we cannot stay here longer,” said Aragorn. He looked towards <b>the</b> mountains <b>and</b> held up his sword. “Farewell, Gandalf! “he cried. “Did I not say <b>to</b> you: if you pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> Moria, beware? Alas that I spoke true! What hope have we without you?”
<br>   He turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company. “We must do without hope,” he said. “At least we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves <b>and</b> weep <b>no</b> more! Come! We have a long road, <b>and</b> much <b>to</b> do.”
<br>   They rose <b>and</b> looked about them. Northward <b>the</b> dale ran up <b>into</b> a glen <b>of</b> shadows between two great arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, above which three white peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Moria. At <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder <b>of</b> short falls, <b>and</b> a mist <b>of</b> foam hung in <b>the</b> air about <b>the</b> mountains” feet.
<br>   “Yonder is <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair,” said Aragorn, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> falls. “Down <b>the</b> deep-cloven way that climbs beside <b>the</b> torrent we should have come, if fortune had been kinder.”
<br>   “Or Caradhras less cruel,” said Gimli. “There he stands smiling in <b>the</b> sun! “He shook his fist at <b>the</b> furthest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow-capped peaks <b>and</b> turned away.
<br>   To <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> outflung arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains marched <b>to</b> a sudden end, <b>and</b> far lands could be descried beyond them, wide <b>and</b> vague. To <b>the</b> south <b>the</b> Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than a mile away, <b>and</b> a little below them, for they still stood high up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dale, there lay a mere. It was long <b>and</b> oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> northern glen; <b>but</b> its southern end was beyond <b>the</b> shadows under <b>the</b> sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was still <b>and</b> unruffled. About <b>it</b> lay a smooth sward, shelving down <b>on</b> all sides <b>to</b> its bare unbroken rim.
<br>   “There lies <b>the</b> Mirrormere, deep Kheled-z?ram! “said Gimli sadly. “I remember that he said: “May you have joy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight! But we cannot linger there.” Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again. It is I that must hasten away, <b>and</b> he that must remain.”
<br>   The Company now went down <b>the</b> road from <b>the</b> Gates. It was rough <b>and</b> broken, fading <b>to</b> a winding track between heather <b>and</b> whin that thrust amid <b>the</b> cracking stones. But still <b>it</b> could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from <b>the</b> lowlands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarf-kingdom. In places there were ruined works <b>of</b> stone beside <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> mounds <b>of</b> green topped with slender birches, <b>or</b> fir-trees sighing in <b>the</b> wind. An eastward bend led them hard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sward <b>of</b> Mirrormere, <b>and</b> there not far from <b>the</b> roadside stood a single column broken at <b>the</b> top.
<br>   “That is Durin's Stone! “cried Gimli. “I cannot pass without turning aside for a moment <b>to</b> look at <b>the</b> wonder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dale!”
<br>   “Be swift then! “said Aragorn, looking back towards <b>the</b> Gates. “The Sun sinks early. The Orcs will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, <b>but</b> we must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will be dark tonight.”
<br>   “Come with me, Frodo! “cried <b>the</b> dwarf, springing from <b>the</b> road. “I would not have you go without seeing Kheled-z?ram.” He ran down <b>the</b> long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> still blue water in spite <b>of</b> hurt <b>and</b> weariness; Sam came up behind.
<br>   Beside <b>the</b> standing stone Gimli halted <b>and</b> looked up. It was cracked <b>and</b> weather-worn, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> faint runes upon its side could not be read. “This pillar marks <b>the</b> spot where Durin first looked in <b>the</b> Mirrormere,” said <b>the</b> dwarf. “Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!”
<br>   They stooped over <b>the</b> dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then slowly they saw <b>the</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> peaks were like plumes <b>of</b> white flame above them; beyond there was a space <b>of</b> sky. There like jewels sunk in <b>the</b> deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight was in <b>the</b> sky above. Of their own stooping forms <b>no</b> shadow could be seen.
<br>   “O Kheled-z?ram fair <b>and</b> wonderful! “said Gimli. “There lies <b>the</b> Crown <b>of</b> Durin till he wakes. Farewell! “He bowed, <b>and</b> turned away, <b>and</b> hastened back up <b>the</b> green-sward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road again.
<br>   “What did you see? “said Pippin <b>to</b> Sam, <b>but</b> Sam was too deep in thought <b>to</b> answer.
<br>   The road now turned south <b>and</b> went quickly downwards, running out from between <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dale. Some way below <b>the</b> mere they came <b>on</b> a deep well <b>of</b> water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip <b>and</b> ran glistening <b>and</b> gurgling down a steep rocky channel.
<br>   “Here is <b>the</b> spring from which <b>the</b> Silverlode rises.” said Gimli. “Do not drink <b>of</b> <b>it</b>! It is icy cold.”
<br>   “Soon <b>it</b> becomes a swift river, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> gathers water from many other mountain-streams,” said Aragorn. “Our road leads beside <b>it</b> for many miles. For I shall take you <b>by</b> <b>the</b> road that Gandalf chose, <b>and</b> first I hope <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods where <b>the</b> Silverlode flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Great River-out yonder.” They looked as he pointed, <b>and</b> before them they could see <b>the</b> stream leaping down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trough <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley, <b>and</b> then running <b>on</b> <b>and</b> away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower lands, until <b>it</b> was lost in a golden haze.
<br>   “There lie <b>the</b> woods <b>of</b> Lothl?rien! “said Legolas. “That is <b>the</b> fairest <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> dwellings <b>of</b> my people. There are <b>no</b> trees like <b>the</b> trees <b>of</b> that land. For in <b>the</b> autumn their leaves fall not, <b>but</b> turn <b>to</b> gold. Not till <b>the</b> spring comes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new green opens do they fall, <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> boughs are laden with yellow flowers; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood is golden, <b>and</b> golden is <b>the</b> roof, <b>and</b> its pillars are <b>of</b> silver, for <b>the</b> bark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees is smooth <b>and</b> grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would be glad if I were beneath <b>the</b> eaves <b>of</b> that wood, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> were springtime!”
<br>   “My heart will be glad, even in <b>the</b> winter,” said Aragorn. “But <b>it</b> lies many miles away. Let us hasten!”
<br>   For some time Frodo <b>and</b> Sam managed <b>to</b> keep up with <b>the</b> others; <b>but</b> Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, <b>and</b> after a while they lagged behind. They had eaten nothing since <b>the</b> early morning. Sam's cut was burning like fire, <b>and</b> his head felt light. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shining sun <b>the</b> wind seemed chill after <b>the</b> warm darkness <b>of</b> Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step more painful <b>and</b> he gasped for breath.
<br>   At last Legolas turned, <b>and</b> seeing them now far behind, he spoke <b>to</b> Aragorn. The others halted, <b>and</b> Aragorn ran back, calling <b>to</b> Boromir <b>to</b> come with him.
<br>   “I am sorry, Frodo! “he cried, full <b>of</b> concern. “So much has happened this day <b>and</b> we have such need <b>of</b> haste, that I have forgotten that you were hurt; <b>and</b> Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing <b>to</b> ease you, as we ought, though all <b>the</b> orcs <b>of</b> Moria were after us. Come now! A little further <b>on</b> there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.”
<br>   Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from <b>the</b> west, <b>and</b> joined its bubbling water with <b>the</b> hurrying Silverlode. Together they plunged over a fall <b>of</b> green-hued stone, <b>and</b> foamed down <b>into</b> a dell. About <b>it</b> stood fir-trees, short <b>and</b> bent, <b>and</b> its sides were steep <b>and</b> clothed with harts-tongue <b>and</b> shrubs <b>of</b> whortle-berry. At <b>the</b> bottom there was a level space through which <b>the</b> stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours after noon, <b>and</b> they had come only a few miles from <b>the</b> Gates. Already <b>the</b> sun was westering.
<br>   While Gimli <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two younger hobbits kindled a fire <b>of</b> brush- <b>and</b> fir-wood, <b>and</b> drew water, Aragorn tended Sam <b>and</b> Frodo. Sam's wound was not deep, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> looked ugly, <b>and</b> Aragorn's face was grave as he examined <b>it</b>. After a moment he looked up with relief.
<br>   “Good luck, Sam! “he said. “Many have received worse than this in payment for <b>the</b> slaying <b>of</b> their first orc. The cut is not poisoned, as <b>the</b> wounds <b>of</b> orc-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended <b>it</b>. Bathe <b>it</b> when Gimli has heated water.”
<br>   He opened his pouch <b>and</b> drew out some withered leaves. “They are dry <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> their virtue has one, he said, <b>but</b> here I have still some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> athelas that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> wash <b>the</b> wound clean, <b>and</b> I will bind <b>it</b>. Now <b>it</b> is your turn. Frodo!”
<br>   “I am all right,” said Frodo, reluctant <b>to</b> have his garments touched. “All I needed was some food <b>and</b> a little rest.”
<br>   “No! “said Aragorn. “We must have a look <b>and</b> see what <b>the</b> hammer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> anvil have done <b>to</b> you. I still marvel that you are alive at all.” Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket <b>and</b> worn tunic, <b>and</b> gave a gasp <b>of</b> wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like <b>the</b> light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took <b>it</b> off <b>and</b> held <b>it</b> up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gems <b>on</b> <b>it</b> glittered like stars. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaken rings was like <b>the</b> tinkle <b>of</b> rain in a pool.
<br>   “Look, my friends!” he called. “Here's a pretty hobbit-skin <b>to</b> wrap an elven-princeling in! If <b>it</b> were known that hobbits had such hides, all <b>the</b> hunters <b>of</b> Middle-earth would be riding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire.”
<br>   “And all <b>the</b> arrows <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> hunters in <b>the</b> world would be in vain,” said Gimli, gazing at <b>the</b> mail in wonder. “It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I have never seen <b>or</b> heard tell <b>of</b> one so fair. Is this <b>the</b> coat that Gandalf spoke <b>of</b>? Then he undervalued <b>it</b>. But <b>it</b> was well given!”
<br>   “I have often wondered what you <b>and</b> Bilbo were doing, so close in his little room,” said Merry. “Bless <b>the</b> old hobbit! I love him more than ever. I hope we get a chance <b>of</b> telling him about <b>it</b>!”
<br>   There was a dark <b>and</b> blackened bruise <b>on</b> Frodo's right side <b>and</b> breast. Under <b>the</b> mail there was a shirt <b>of</b> soft leather, <b>but</b> at one point <b>the</b> rings had been driven through <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flesh. Frodo's left side also was scored <b>and</b> bruised where he had been hurled against <b>the</b> wall. While <b>the</b> others set <b>the</b> food ready. Aragorn bathed <b>the</b> hurts with water in which athelas was steeped. The pungent fragrance filled <b>the</b> dell, <b>and</b> all those who stooped over <b>the</b> steaming water felt refreshed <b>and</b> strengthened. Soon Frodo felt <b>the</b> pain leave him, <b>and</b> his breath grew easy: though he was stiff <b>and</b> sore <b>to</b> <b>the</b> touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads <b>of</b> cloth at his side.
<br>   “The mail is marvellously light,” he said. “Put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> again, if you can bear <b>it</b>. My heart is glad <b>to</b> know that you have such a coat. Do not lay <b>it</b> aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while; <b>and</b> that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.”
<br>   When they had eaten, <b>the</b> Company got ready <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>. They put out <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> hid all traces <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Then climbing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell they took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road again. They had not gone far before <b>the</b> sun sank behind <b>the</b> westward heights <b>and</b> great shadows crept down <b>the</b> mountain-sides. Dusk veiled their feet, <b>and</b> mist rose in <b>the</b> hollows. Away in <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> evening light lay pale upon <b>the</b> dim lands <b>of</b> distant plain <b>and</b> wood. Sam <b>and</b> Frodo now feeling eased <b>and</b> greatly refreshed were able <b>to</b> go at a fair pace, <b>and</b> with only one brief halt Aragorn led <b>the</b> Company <b>on</b> for nearly three more hours.
<br>   It was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, hut <b>the</b> fast-waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli <b>and</b> Frodo were at <b>the</b> rear, walking softly <b>and</b> not speaking, listening for any sound upon <b>the</b> road behind. At length Gimli broke <b>the</b> silence.
<br>   “Not a sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wind,” he said. “There are <b>no</b> goblins near, <b>or</b> my ears are made <b>of</b> wood. It is <b>to</b> be hoped that <b>the</b> Orcs will be content with driving us from Moria. And maybe that was all their purpose, <b>and</b> they had nothing else <b>to</b> do with us-with <b>the</b> Ring. Though Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plain, if they have a fallen captain <b>to</b> avenge.”
<br>   Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blade was dull. Yet he had heard something, <b>or</b> thought he had. As soon as <b>the</b> shadows had fallen about them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road behind was dim, he had heard again <b>the</b> quick patter <b>of</b> feet. Even now he heard <b>it</b>. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams <b>of</b> light behind, <b>or</b> for a moment he thought he saw them, <b>but</b> at once they slipped aside <b>and</b> vanished.
<br>   “What is <b>it</b>? “said <b>the</b> dwarf.
<br>   “I don't know.” answered Frodo. “I thought I heard feet, <b>and</b> I thought I saw a light-like eyes. I have thought so often, since we first entered Moria.”
<br>   Gimli halted <b>and</b> stooped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. “I hear nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> night-speech <b>of</b> plant <b>and</b> stone,” he said. “Come! Let us hurry! The others are out <b>of</b> sight.”
<br>   The night-wind blew chill up <b>the</b> valley <b>to</b> meet them. Before them a wide grey shadow loomed, <b>and</b> they heard an endless rustle <b>of</b> leaves like poplars in <b>the</b> breeze.
<br>   “Lothl?rien! “cried Legolas. “Lothl?rien! We have come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Wood. Alas that <b>it</b> is winter!”
<br>   Under <b>the</b> night <b>the</b> trees stood tall before them, arched over <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In <b>the</b> dim light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars their stems were grey, <b>and</b> their quivering leaves a hint <b>of</b> fallow gold.
<br>   “Lothl?rien! “said Aragorn. “Glad I am <b>to</b> hear again <b>the</b> wind in <b>the</b> trees! We are still little more than five leagues from <b>the</b> Gates, <b>but</b> we can go <b>no</b> further. Here let us hope that <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves will keep us tonight from <b>the</b> peril that comes behind.”
<br>   “If Elves indeed still dwell here in <b>the</b> darkening world,” said Gimli.
<br>   “It is long since any <b>of</b> my own folk journeyed hither back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land whence we wandered in ages long ago,” said Legolas, “<b>but</b> we hear that L?rien is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from <b>the</b> land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, <b>and</b> maybe they dwell now deep in <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> far from <b>the</b> northern border.”
<br>   “Indeed deep in <b>the</b> wood they dwell,” said Aragorn, <b>and</b> sighed as if some memory stirred in him. “We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go forward a short way, until <b>the</b> trees are all about us, <b>and</b> then we will turn aside from <b>the</b> path <b>and</b> seek a place <b>to</b> rest in.”
<br>   He stepped forward; <b>but</b> Boromir stood irresolute <b>and</b> did not follow. “Is there <b>no</b> other way? “he said.
<br>   “What other fairer way would you desire? “said Aragorn.
<br>   “A plain road, though <b>it</b> led through a hedge <b>of</b> swords,” said Boromir. “By strange paths has this Company been led, <b>and</b> so far <b>to</b> evil fortune. Against my will we passed under <b>the</b> shades <b>of</b> Moria, <b>to</b> our loss. And now we must enter <b>the</b> Golden Wood, you say. But <b>of</b> that perilous land we have heard in Gondor, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is said that few come out who once go in; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> that few none have escaped unscathed.”
<br>   “Say not unscathed, <b>but</b> if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak <b>the</b> truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> those who once were wise they now speak evil <b>of</b> Lothl?rien. Believe what you will, there is <b>no</b> other way for us—unless you would go back <b>to</b> Moria-gate, <b>or</b> scale <b>the</b> pathless mountains, <b>or</b> swim <b>the</b> Great River all alone.”
<br>   “Then lead <b>on</b>! “said Boromir. “But <b>it</b> is perilous.”
<br>   “Perilous indeed,” said Aragorn, “fair <b>and</b> perilous; <b>but</b> only evil need fear <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> those who bring some evil with them. Follow me!”
<br>   They had gone little more than a mile <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from <b>the</b> tree-clad slopes that climbed back westward towards <b>the</b> mountains. They heard <b>it</b> splashing over a fall away among <b>the</b> shadows <b>on</b> their right. Its dark hurrying waters ran across <b>the</b> path before them, <b>and</b> joined <b>the</b> Silverlode in a swirl <b>of</b> dim pools among <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> trees.
<br>   “Here is Nimrodel! “said Legolas. “Of this stream <b>the</b> Silvan Elves made many songs long ago, <b>and</b> still we sing them in <b>the</b> North, remembering <b>the</b> rainbow <b>on</b> its falls, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> golden flowers that floated in its foam. All is dark now <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bridge <b>of</b> Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my feet, for <b>it</b> is said that <b>the</b> water is healing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weary.” He went forward <b>and</b> climbed down <b>the</b> deep-cloven bank <b>and</b> stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream.
<br>   “Follow me!” he cried. “The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On <b>the</b> further bank we can rest. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falling water may bring us sleep <b>and</b> forgetfulness <b>of</b> grief.”
<br>   One <b>by</b> one they climbed down <b>and</b> followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo stood near <b>the</b> brink <b>and</b> let <b>the</b> water flow over his tired feet. It was cold <b>but</b> its touch was clean, <b>and</b> as he went <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> mounted <b>to</b> his knees, he felt that <b>the</b> stain <b>of</b> travel <b>and</b> all weariness was washed from his limbs.
<br>   When all <b>the</b> Company had crossed, they sat <b>and</b> rested <b>and</b> ate a little food; <b>and</b> Legolas told them tales <b>of</b> Lothl?rien that <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Mirkwood still kept in their hearts, <b>of</b> sunlight <b>and</b> starlight upon <b>the</b> meadows <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Great River before <b>the</b> world was grey.
<br>   At length a silence fell, <b>and</b> they heard <b>the</b> music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waterfall running sweetly in <b>the</b> shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing, mingled with <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water.
<br>   “Do you hear <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Nimrodel? “asked Legolas. “I will sing you a song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maiden Nimrodel, who bore <b>the</b> same name as <b>the</b> stream beside which she lived lung ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; <b>but</b> this is how <b>it</b> runs in <b>the</b> Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing <b>it</b>.” In a soft voice hardly <b>to</b> be heard amid <b>the</b> rustle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves above them he began:
<br>   
<br>An Elven-maid there was <b>of</b> old,
<br>A shining star <b>by</b> day:
<br>Her mantle white was hemmed with gold,
<br>Her shoes <b>of</b> silver-grey.
<br>
<br>A star was bound upon her brows,
<br>A light was <b>on</b> her hair
<br>As sun upon <b>the</b> golden boughs
<br>In L?rien <b>the</b> fair.
<br>
<br>Her hair was long, her limbs were white,
<br>And fair she was <b>and</b> free;
<br>And in <b>the</b> wind she went as light
<br>As leaf <b>of</b> linden-tree.
<br>
<br>Beside <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Nimrodel,
<br>By water clear <b>and</b> cool,
<br>Her voice as falling silver fell
<br>Into <b>the</b> shining pool.
<br>
<br>Where now she wanders none can tell,
<br>In sunlight <b>or</b> in shade;
<br>For lost <b>of</b> yore was Nimrodel
<br>And in <b>the</b> mountains strayed.
<br>
<br>The elven-ship in haven grey
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> mountain-lee
<br>Awaited her for many a day
<br>Beside <b>the</b> roaring sea.
<br>
<br>A wind <b>by</b> night in Northern lands
<br>Arose, <b>and</b> loud <b>it</b> cried,
<br>And drove <b>the</b> ship from elven-strands
<br>Across <b>the</b> streaming tide.
<br>
<br>When dawn came dim <b>the</b> land was lost,
<br>The mountains sinking grey
<br>Beyond <b>the</b> heaving waves that tossed
<br>Their plumes <b>of</b> blinding spray.
<br>
<br>Amroth beheld <b>the</b> fading shore
<br>Now low beyond <b>the</b> swell,
<br>And cursed <b>the</b> faithless ship that bore
<br>Him far from Nimrodel.
<br>
<br>Of old he was an Elven-king,
<br>A lord <b>of</b> tree <b>and</b> glen,
<br>When golden were <b>the</b> boughs in spring
<br>In fair Lothl?rien.
<br>
<br>From helm <b>to</b> sea they saw him leap,
<br>As arrow from <b>the</b> string,
<br>And dive <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water deep,
<br>As mew upon <b>the</b> wing.
<br>
<br>The wind was in his flowing hair,
<br>The foam about him shone;
<br>Afar they saw him strong <b>and</b> fair
<br>Go riding like a swan.
<br>
<br>But from <b>the</b> West has come <b>no</b> word,
<br>And <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hither Shore
<br>No tidings Elven-folk have heard
<br>Of Amroth evermore.
<br>   
<br>   The voice <b>of</b> Legolas faltered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> song ceased. “I cannot sing any more,” he said. “That is <b>but</b> a part, for I have forgotten much. It is long <b>and</b> sad, for <b>it</b> tells how sorrow came upon Lothl?rien, L?rien <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blossom, when <b>the</b> Dwarves awakened evil in <b>the</b> mountains.”
<br>   “But <b>the</b> Dwarves did not make <b>the</b> evil,” said Gimli.
<br>   “I said not so; yet evil came,” answered Legolas sadly. “Then many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Nimrodel's kindred left their dwellings <b>and</b> departed <b>and</b> she was lost far in <b>the</b> South, in <b>the</b> passes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains; <b>and</b> she came not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in <b>the</b> spring when <b>the</b> wind is in <b>the</b> new leaves <b>the</b> echo <b>of</b> her voice may still be heard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> falls that bear her name. And when <b>the</b> wind is in <b>the</b> South <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Amroth comes up from <b>the</b> sea; for Nimrodel flows <b>into</b> Silverlode, that Elves call Celebrant, <b>and</b> Celebrant <b>into</b> Anduin <b>the</b> Great. <b>and</b> Anduin flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Belfalas whence <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> L?rien set sail. But neither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back.
<br>   “It is told that she had a house built in <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> a tree that grew near <b>the</b> falls; for that was <b>the</b> custom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> L?rien, <b>to</b> dwell in <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> maybe <b>it</b> is so still. Therefore they were called <b>the</b> Galadhrim, <b>the</b> Tree-people. Deep in their forest <b>the</b> trees are very great. The people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods did not delve in <b>the</b> ground like Dwarves, nor build strong places <b>of</b> stone before <b>the</b> Shadow came.”
<br>   “And even in these latter days dwelling in <b>the</b> trees might be thought safer than sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground,” said Gimli. He looked across <b>the</b> stream <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road that led back <b>to</b> Dimrill Dale, <b>and</b> then up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> dark boughs above.
<br>   “Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,” said Aragorn. “We cannot build a house, <b>but</b> tonight we will do as <b>the</b> Galadhrim <b>and</b> seek refuge in <b>the</b> tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside <b>the</b> road already longer than was wise.”
<br>   The Company now turned aside from <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeper woods, westward along <b>the</b> mountain-stream away from Silverlode. Not far from <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Nimrodel they found a cluster <b>of</b> trees, some <b>of</b> which overhung <b>the</b> stream. Their great grey trunks were <b>of</b> mighty girth, <b>but</b> their height could not be guessed.
<br>   “I will climb up,” said Legolas. “I am at home among trees, <b>by</b> root <b>or</b> bough, though these trees are <b>of</b> a kind strange <b>to</b> me, save as a name in song. Mellyrn they are called, <b>and</b> are those that bear <b>the</b> yellow blossom, <b>but</b> I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is their shape <b>and</b> way <b>of</b> growth.”
<br>   “Whatever <b>it</b> may be,” said Pippin, “they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except <b>to</b> birds. I cannot sleep <b>on</b> a perch!”
<br>   “Then dig a hole in <b>the</b> ground,” said Legolas, “if that is more after <b>the</b> fashion <b>of</b> your kind. But you must dig swift <b>and</b> deep, if you wish <b>to</b> hide from Orcs.” He sprang lightly up from <b>the</b> ground <b>and</b> caught a branch that grew from <b>the</b> trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from <b>the</b> tree-shadows above him.
<br>   “Daro!” <b>it</b> said in commanding tone, <b>and</b> Legolas dropped back <b>to</b> earth in surprise <b>and</b> fear. He shrank against <b>the</b> bole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree.
<br>   “Stand still! “he whispered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “Do not move <b>or</b> speak!”
<br>   There was a sound <b>of</b> soft laughter over their heads, <b>and</b> then another clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little <b>of</b> what was said, for <b>the</b> speech that <b>the</b> Silvan folk east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains used among themselves was unlike that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. Legolas looked up <b>and</b> answered in <b>the</b> same language.*
<br>   “Who are they, <b>and</b> what do they say? “asked Merry.
<br>   “They're Elves,” said Sam. “Can't you hear their voices?”
<br>   “Yes, they are Elves,” said Legolas; “<b>and</b> they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in <b>the</b> dark.” Sam hastily put his hand over his mouth. “But they say also that you need have <b>no</b> fear. They have been aware <b>of</b> us for a long while. They heard my voice across <b>the</b> Nimrodel, <b>and</b> knew that I was one <b>of</b> their Northern kindred, <b>and</b> therefore they did not hinder our crossing; <b>and</b> afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with Frodo; for they seem <b>to</b> have had some tidings <b>of</b> him <b>and</b> <b>of</b> our journey. The others they ask <b>to</b> wait a little <b>and</b> <b>to</b> keep watch at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, until they have decided what is <b>to</b> be done.”
<br>   Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows a ladder was let down: <b>it</b> was made <b>of</b> rope, silver-grey <b>and</b> glimmering in <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> though <b>it</b> looked slender <b>it</b> proved strong enough <b>to</b> bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, <b>and</b> Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not <b>to</b> breathe loudly. The branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from <b>the</b> trunk, <b>and</b> then swept upward; <b>but</b> near <b>the</b> top <b>the</b> main stem divided <b>into</b> a crown <b>of</b> many boughs, <b>and</b> among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, <b>or</b> flet as such things were called in those days: <b>the</b> Elves called <b>it</b> a talan. It was reached <b>by</b> a round hole in <b>the</b> centre through which <b>the</b> ladder passed.
<br>   When Frodo came at last up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves. They were clad in shadowy-grey, <b>and</b> could not be seen among <b>the</b> tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, <b>and</b> one <b>of</b> them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held <b>it</b> up, looking at Frodo's face, <b>and</b> Sam's. Then he shut off <b>the</b> light again, <b>and</b> spoke words <b>of</b> welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in return.
<br>   “Welcome!” <b>the</b> Elf then said again in <b>the</b> Common Language, speaking slowly. “We seldom use any tongue <b>but</b> our own; for we dwell now in <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest, <b>and</b> do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even our own kindred in <b>the</b> North are sundered from us. But there are some <b>of</b> us still who go abroad for <b>the</b> gathering <b>of</b> news <b>and</b> <b>the</b> watching <b>of</b> our enemies, <b>and</b> they speak <b>the</b> languages <b>of</b> other lands. I am one. Haldir is my name. My brothers, R?mil <b>and</b> Orophin, speak little <b>of</b> your tongue.
<br>   “But we have heard rumours <b>of</b> your coming, for <b>the</b> messengers <b>of</b> Elrond passed <b>by</b> L?rien <b>on</b> their way home up <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair. We had not heard <b>of</b> hobbits, <b>or</b> halflings, for many a long year, <b>and</b> did not know that any yet dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not look evil! And since you come with an Elf <b>of</b> our kindred, we are willing <b>to</b> befriend you, as Elrond asked; though <b>it</b> is not our custom <b>to</b> lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here tonight. How many are you?”
<br>   “Eight,” said Legolas. “Myself, four hobbits; <b>and</b> two men, one <b>of</b> whom, Aragorn, is an Elf-friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Westernesse.”
<br>   “The name <b>of</b> Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn is known in L?rien,” said Haldir, “<b>and</b> he has <b>the</b> favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady. All then is well. But you have yet spoken only <b>of</b> seven.”
<br>   “The eighth is a dwarf,” said Legolas.
<br>   “A dwarf! “said Haldir. “That is not well. We have not had dealings with <b>the</b> Dwarves since <b>the</b> Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I cannot allow him <b>to</b> pass.”
<br>   “But he is from <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain, one <b>of</b> D?in's trusty people, <b>and</b> friendly <b>to</b> Elrond,” said Frodo. “Elrond himself chose him <b>to</b> be one <b>of</b> our companions, <b>and</b> he has been brave <b>and</b> faithful.”
<br>   The Elves spoke together in soft voices, <b>and</b> questioned Legolas in their own tongue. “Very good,” said Haldir at last. “We will do this, though <b>it</b> is against our liking. If Aragorn <b>and</b> Legolas will guard him, <b>and</b> answer for him, he shall pass; <b>but</b> he must go blindfold through Lothl?rien.
<br>   “But now we must debate <b>no</b> longer. Your folk must not remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. We have been keeping watch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rivers, ever since we saw a great troop <b>of</b> Orcs going north toward Moria, along <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, many days ago. Wolves are howling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wood's borders. If you have indeed come from Moria, <b>the</b> peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go <b>on</b>.
<br>   “The four hobbits shall climb up here <b>and</b> stay with us-we do not fear them! There is another talan in <b>the</b> next tree. There <b>the</b> others must take refuge. You, Legolas, must answer <b>to</b> us for them. Call us, if anything is amiss! And have an eye <b>on</b> that dwarf!”
<br>   Legolas at once went down <b>the</b> ladder <b>to</b> take Haldir's message; <b>and</b> soon afterwards Merry <b>and</b> Pippin clambered up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high flet. They were out <b>of</b> breath <b>and</b> seemed rather scared.
<br>   “There!” said Merry panting. “We have lugged up your blankets as well as our own. Strider has hidden all <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baggage in a deep drift <b>of</b> leaves.”
<br>   “You had <b>no</b> need <b>of</b> your burdens,” said Haldir. “It is cold in <b>the</b> tree-tops in winter, though <b>the</b> wind tonight is in <b>the</b> South; <b>but</b> we have food <b>and</b> drink <b>to</b> give you that will drive away <b>the</b> night-chill, <b>and</b> we have skins <b>and</b> cloaks <b>to</b> spare.”
<br>   The hobbits accepted this second (<b>and</b> far better) supper very gladly. Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in <b>the</b> fur-cloaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, <b>but</b> in their own blankets as well, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> sleep. But weary as they were only Sam found that easy <b>to</b> do. Hobbits do not like heights, <b>and</b> do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet was not at all <b>to</b> their liking as a bedroom. It had <b>no</b> walls. not even a rail; only <b>on</b> one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be moved <b>and</b> fixed in different places according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind.
<br>   Pippin went <b>on</b> talking for a while. “I hope, if I do go <b>to</b> sleep in this bed-loft, that I shan't roll off,” he said.
<br>   “Once I do get <b>to</b> sleep,” said Sam, “i shall go <b>on</b> sleeping, whether I roll off <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. And <b>the</b> less said, <b>the</b> sooner I'll drop off, if you take my meaning.”
<br>   Frodo lay for some time awake, <b>and</b> looked up at <b>the</b> stars glinting through <b>the</b> pale roof <b>of</b> quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see <b>the</b> grey forms <b>of</b> two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in whispers. The other had gone down <b>to</b> take up his watch <b>on</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower branches. At last lulled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wind in <b>the</b> boughs above, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sweet murmur <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with <b>the</b> song <b>of</b> Legolas running in his mind.
<br>   Late in <b>the</b> night he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among <b>the</b> leaves. The wind was still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tread <b>of</b> many feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground below. There was a ring <b>of</b> metal. The sounds died slowly away, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> go southward, <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood.
<br>   A head appeared suddenly through <b>the</b> hole in <b>the</b> flet. Frodo sat up in alarm <b>and</b> saw that <b>it</b> was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “What is <b>it</b>? “said Frodo.
<br>   “Yrch!” said <b>the</b> Elf in a hissing whisper, <b>and</b> cast <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flet <b>the</b> rope-ladder rolled up.
<br>   “Orcs! “said Frodo. “What are they doing? “But <b>the</b> Elf had gone.
<br>   There were <b>no</b> more sounds. Even <b>the</b> leaves were silent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> very falls seemed <b>to</b> be hushed. Frodo sat <b>and</b> shivered in his wraps. He was thankful that they had not been caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground; <b>but</b> he felt that <b>the</b> trees offered little protection, except concealment. Orcs were as keen as hounds <b>on</b> a scent, <b>it</b> was said, <b>but</b> they could also climb. He drew out Sting: <b>it</b> flashed <b>and</b> glittered like a blue flame <b>and</b> then slowly faded again <b>and</b> grew dull. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fading <b>of</b> his sword <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather <b>it</b> grew stronger. He got up <b>and</b> crawled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opening <b>and</b> peered down. He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at <b>the</b> tree's foot far below.
<br>   Not Elves; for <b>the</b> woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: <b>and</b> something seemed <b>to</b> be scrabbling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree-trunk. He stared down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark, holding his breath.
<br>   Something was now climbing slowly, <b>and</b> its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes. They stopped <b>and</b> gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they turned away, <b>and</b> a shadowy figure slipped round <b>the</b> trunk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>and</b> vanished.
<br>   Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through <b>the</b> branches. “There was something in this tree that I have never seen before,” he said. “It was not an orc. It fled as soon as I touched <b>the</b> tree-stem. It seemed <b>to</b> be wary, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> have some skill in trees, <b>or</b> I might have thought that <b>it</b> was one <b>of</b> you hobbits.
<br>   “I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk battle. A strong company <b>of</b> Orcs has passed. They crossed <b>the</b> Nimrodel-curse their foul feet in its clean water!-<b>and</b> went <b>on</b> down <b>the</b> old road beside <b>the</b> river. They seemed <b>to</b> pick up some scent, <b>and</b> they searched <b>the</b> ground for a while near <b>the</b> place where you halted. The three <b>of</b> us could not challenge a hundred, so we went ahead <b>and</b> spoke with feigned voices, leading them <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood.
<br>   “Orophin has now gone in haste back <b>to</b> our dwellings <b>to</b> warn our people. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orcs will ever return out <b>of</b> L?rien. And there will be many Elves hidden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern border before another night falls. But you must take <b>the</b> road south as soon as <b>it</b> is fully light.”
<br>   Day came pale from <b>the</b> East. As <b>the</b> light grew <b>it</b> filtered through <b>the</b> yellow leaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mallorn, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits that <b>the</b> early sun <b>of</b> a cool summer's morning was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among <b>the</b> moving branches. Looking through an opening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flet Frodo saw all <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode lying like a sea <b>of</b> fallow gold tossing gently in <b>the</b> breeze.
<br>   The morning was still young <b>and</b> cold when <b>the</b> Company set out again, guided now <b>by</b> Haldir <b>and</b> his brother R?mil. “Farewell, sweet Nimrodel! “cried Legolas. Frodo looked back <b>and</b> caught a gleam <b>of</b> white foam among <b>the</b> grey tree-stems. “Farewell,” he said. It seemed <b>to</b> him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless changeful music.
<br>   They went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> path that still went <b>on</b> along <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, <b>and</b> for some way they followed <b>it</b> southward. There were <b>the</b> prints <b>of</b> orc-feet in <b>the</b> earth. But soon Haldir turned aside <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> halted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river under their shadows.
<br>   “There is one <b>of</b> my people yonder across <b>the</b> stream,” he said “though you may not see him.” He gave a call like <b>the</b> low whistle <b>of</b> a bird, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> a thicket <b>of</b> young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, <b>but</b> with his hood thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in <b>the</b> morning sun. Haldir skilfully cast over <b>the</b> stream a coil <b>of</b> grey rope, <b>and</b> he caught <b>it</b> <b>and</b> bound <b>the</b> end about a tree near <b>the</b> bank.
<br>   “Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,” said Haldir “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> runs both swift <b>and</b> deep, <b>and</b> is very cold. We do not set foot in <b>it</b> so far north, unless we must. But in these days <b>of</b> watchfulness we do not make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!” He made his end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rope fast about another tree, <b>and</b> then ran lightly along <b>it</b>, over <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> back again, as if he were <b>on</b> a road.
<br>   “I can walk this path,” said Legolas; “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> others have not this skill. Must they swim?”
<br>   “No!” said Haldir. “We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above <b>the</b> other, one shoulder-high, <b>and</b> another half-high, <b>and</b> holding these <b>the</b> strangers should be able <b>to</b> cross with care.”
<br>   When this slender bridge had been made, <b>the</b> Company passed over, some cautiously <b>and</b> slowly, others more easily. Of <b>the</b> hobbits Pippin proved <b>the</b> best for he was sure-footed, <b>and</b> he walked over quickly, holding only with one hand; <b>but</b> he kept his eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank ahead <b>and</b> did not look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, <b>and</b> looking down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pale eddying water as if <b>it</b> was a chasm in <b>the</b> mountains.
<br>   He breathed with relief when he was safely across. “Live <b>and</b> learn! as my gaffer used <b>to</b> say. Though he was thinking <b>of</b> gardening, not <b>of</b> roosting like a bird, nor <b>of</b> trying <b>to</b> walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that!”
<br>   When at length all <b>the</b> Company was gathered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, <b>the</b> Elves untied <b>the</b> ropes <b>and</b> coiled two <b>of</b> them. R?mil, who had remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side, drew back <b>the</b> last one, slung <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder, <b>and</b> with a wave <b>of</b> his hand went away, back <b>to</b> Nimrodel <b>to</b> keep watch.
<br>   “Now, friends,” said Haldir, “you have entered <b>the</b> Naith <b>of</b> L?rien <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Gore, as you would say, for <b>it</b> is <b>the</b> land that lies like a spear-head between <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> Silverlode <b>and</b> Anduin <b>the</b> Great. We allow <b>no</b> strangers <b>to</b> spy out <b>the</b> secrets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naith. Few indeed are permitted even <b>to</b> set foot there.
<br>   “As was agreed, I shall here blindfold <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> Gimli <b>the</b> Dwarf. The other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer <b>to</b> our dwellings, down in Egladil, in <b>the</b> Angle between <b>the</b> waters.”
<br>   This was not at all <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liking <b>of</b> Gimli. “The agreement was made without my consent,” he said. “I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar <b>or</b> a prisoner. And I am <b>no</b> spy. My folk have never had dealings with any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Neither have we done harm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elves. I am <b>no</b> more likely <b>to</b> betray you than Legolas, <b>or</b> any other <b>of</b> my companions.”
<br>   “I do not doubt you,” said Haldir. “Yet this is our law. I am not <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law, <b>and</b> cannot set <b>it</b> aside. I have done much in letting you set foot over Celebrant.”
<br>   Gimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, <b>and</b> laid his hand upon <b>the</b> haft <b>of</b> his axe. “I will go forward free,” he said, “<b>or</b> I will go back <b>and</b> seek my own land, where I am known <b>to</b> be true <b>of</b> word, though I perish alone in <b>the</b> wilderness.”
<br>   “You cannot go back,” said Haldir sternly. “Now you have come thus far, you must be brought before <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lady. They shall judge you, <b>to</b> hold you <b>or</b> <b>to</b> give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross <b>the</b> rivers again, <b>and</b> behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before you saw them.”
<br>   Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir <b>and</b> his companion bent their bows. “A plague <b>on</b> Dwarves <b>and</b> their stiff necks! “said Legolas.
<br>   “Come!” said Aragorn. “If I am still <b>to</b> lead this Company, you must do as I bid. It is hard upon <b>the</b> Dwarf <b>to</b> be thus singled out. We will all be blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though <b>it</b> will make <b>the</b> journey slow <b>and</b> dull.”
<br>   Gimli laughed suddenly. “A merry troop <b>of</b> fools we shall look! Will Haldir lead us all <b>on</b> a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.”
<br>   “I am an Elf <b>and</b> a kinsman here,” said Legolas, becoming angry in his turn.
<br>   “Now let us cry: “a plague <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stiff necks <b>of</b> Elves!” said Aragorn. “But <b>the</b> Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir!”
<br>   “I shall claim full amends for every fall <b>and</b> stubbed toe, if you do not lead us well,” said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes.
<br>   “You will have <b>no</b> claim,” said Haldir. “I shall lead you well, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> paths are smooth <b>and</b> straight.”
<br>   “Alas for <b>the</b> folly <b>of</b> these days! “said Legolas. “Here all are enemies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one Enemy, <b>and</b> yet I must walk blind, while <b>the</b> sun is merry in <b>the</b> woodland under leaves <b>of</b> gold!”
<br>   “Folly <b>it</b> may seem,” said Haldir. “Indeed in nothing is <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord more clearly shown than in <b>the</b> estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith <b>and</b> trust do we find now in <b>the</b> world beyond Lothl?rien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not <b>by</b> our own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many perils, <b>and</b> our hands are more often upon <b>the</b> bowstring than upon <b>the</b> harp.
<br>   “The rivers long defended us, <b>but</b> they are a sure guard <b>no</b> more for <b>the</b> Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak <b>of</b> departing, yet for that <b>it</b> already seems too late. The mountains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west are growing evil; <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> lands are waste, <b>and</b> full <b>of</b> Sauron's creatures; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River are watched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Even if we could come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, we should find <b>no</b> longer any shelter there. It is said that there are still havens <b>of</b>. <b>the</b> High Elves, <b>but</b> they are far north <b>and</b> west, beyond <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Halflings. But where that may be, though <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady may know, I do not.”
<br>   “You ought at least <b>to</b> guess, since you have seen us,” said Merry. “There are Elf-havens west <b>of</b> my land, <b>the</b> Shire where Hobbits live.”
<br>   “Happy folk are Hobbits <b>to</b> dwell near <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea! “said Haldir. “It is long indeed since any <b>of</b> my folk have looked <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, yet still we remember <b>it</b> in song. Tell me <b>of</b> these havens as we walk.”
<br>   “I cannot,” said Merry. “I have never seen them. I have never been out <b>of</b> my own land before. And if I had known what <b>the</b> world outside was like. I don't think I should have had <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> leave <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Not even <b>to</b> see fair Lothl?rien? “said Haldir. “The world is indeed full <b>of</b> peril, <b>and</b> in <b>it</b> there are many dark places; <b>but</b> still there is much that is fair, <b>and</b> though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, <b>it</b> grows perhaps <b>the</b> greater.
<br>   “Some there are among us who sing that <b>the</b> Shadow will draw back <b>and</b> peace shall come again. Yet I do not believe that <b>the</b> world about us will ever again be as <b>it</b> was <b>of</b> old, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun as <b>it</b> was aforetime. For <b>the</b> Elves, I fear, <b>it</b> will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea unhindered <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> Middle-earth for ever. Alas for Lothl?rien that I love! It would be a poor life in a land where <b>no</b> mallorn grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond <b>the</b> Great Sea, none have reported <b>it</b>.”
<br>   As they spoke thus, <b>the</b> Company filed slowly along <b>the</b> paths in <b>the</b> wood, led <b>by</b> Haldir, while <b>the</b> other Elf walked behind. They felt <b>the</b> ground beneath their feet smooth <b>and</b> soft, <b>and</b> after a while they walked more freely, without fear <b>of</b> hurt <b>or</b> fall. Being deprived <b>of</b> sight, Frodo found his hearing <b>and</b> other senses sharpened. He could smell <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trodden grass. He could hear many different notes in <b>the</b> rustle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves overhead, <b>the</b> river murmuring away <b>on</b> his right, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> thin clear voices <b>of</b> birds in <b>the</b> sky. He felt <b>the</b> sun upon his face <b>and</b> hands when they passed through an open glade.
<br>   As soon as he set foot upon <b>the</b> far bank <b>of</b> Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> deepened as he walked <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Naith: <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he had stepped over a bridge <b>of</b> time <b>into</b> a corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days, <b>and</b> was -now walking in a world that was <b>no</b> more. In Rivendell there was memory <b>of</b> ancient things; in L?rien <b>the</b> ancient things still lived <b>on</b> in <b>the</b> waking world. Evil had been seen <b>and</b> heard there, sorrow had been known; <b>the</b> Elves feared <b>and</b> distrusted <b>the</b> world outside: wolves were howling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wood's borders: <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien <b>no</b> shadow lay.
<br>   All that day <b>the</b> Company marched <b>on</b>, until they felt <b>the</b> cool evening come <b>and</b> heard <b>the</b> early night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then they rested <b>and</b> slept without fear upon <b>the</b> ground; for their guides would not permit them <b>to</b> unbind their eyes, <b>and</b> they could not climb. In <b>the</b> morning they went <b>on</b> again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, <b>and</b> Frodo was aware that they had passed out under <b>the</b> shining Sun. Suddenly he heard <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> many voices all around him.
<br>   A marching host <b>of</b> Elves had come up silently: they were hastening toward <b>the</b> northern borders <b>to</b> guard against any attack from Moria; <b>and</b> they brought news, some <b>of</b> which Haldir reported. The marauding orcs had been waylaid <b>and</b> almost all destroyed; <b>the</b> remnant had fled westward towards <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen, running with bent back <b>and</b> with hands near <b>the</b> ground, like a beast <b>and</b> yet not <b>of</b> beast-shape. It had eluded capture, <b>and</b> they had not shot <b>it</b>, not knowing whether <b>it</b> was good <b>or</b> ill, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> had vanished down <b>the</b> Silverlode southward.
<br>   “Also,” said Haldir, “they bring me a message from <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim. You are all <b>to</b> walk free, even <b>the</b> dwarf Gimli. It seems that <b>the</b> Lady knows who <b>and</b> what is each member <b>of</b> your Company. New messages have come from Rivendell perhaps.”
<br>   He removed <b>the</b> bandage first from Gimli's eyes. “Your pardon! “he said, bowing low. “Look <b>on</b> us now with friendly eyes! Look <b>and</b> be glad, for you are <b>the</b> first dwarf <b>to</b> behold <b>the</b> trees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naith <b>of</b> L?rien since Durin's Day!”
<br>   When his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up <b>and</b> caught his breath. They were standing in an open space. To <b>the</b> left stood a great mound, covered with a sward <b>of</b> grass as green as Spring-time in <b>the</b> Elder Days. Upon <b>it</b>, as a double crown, grew two circles <b>of</b> trees: <b>the</b> outer had bark <b>of</b> snowy white, <b>and</b> were leafless <b>but</b> beautiful in their shapely nakedness; <b>the</b> inner were mallorn-trees <b>of</b> great height, still arrayed in pale gold. High amid <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> a towering tree that stood in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> all there gleamed a white flet. At <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> all about <b>the</b> green hillsides <b>the</b> grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among them, nodding <b>on</b> slender stalks, were other flowers, white <b>and</b> palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid <b>the</b> rich hue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grass. Over all <b>the</b> sky was blue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>of</b> afternoon glowed upon <b>the</b> hill <b>and</b> cast long green shadows beneath <b>the</b> trees.
<br>   “Behold! You are come <b>to</b> Cerin Amroth,” said Haldir. “For this is <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient realm as <b>it</b> was long ago, <b>and</b> here is <b>the</b> mound <b>of</b> Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom <b>the</b> winter flowers in <b>the</b> unfading grass: <b>the</b> yellow elanor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pale niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, <b>and</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim at dusk.”
<br>   The others cast themselves down upon <b>the</b> fragrant grass, <b>but</b> Frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed <b>to</b> him that he had stepped through a high window that looked <b>on</b> a vanished world. A light was upon <b>it</b> for which his language had <b>no</b> name. All that he saw was shapely, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived <b>and</b> drawn at <b>the</b> uncovering <b>of</b> his eyes, <b>and</b> ancient as if they had endured for ever. He saw <b>no</b> colour <b>but</b> those he knew, gold <b>and</b> white <b>and</b> blue <b>and</b> green, <b>but</b> they were fresh <b>and</b> poignant, as if he had at that moment first perceived them <b>and</b> made for them names new <b>and</b> wonderful. In winter here <b>no</b> heart could mourn for summer <b>or</b> for spring. No blemish <b>or</b> sickness <b>or</b> deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon <b>the</b> earth. On <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien there was <b>no</b> stain.
<br>   He turned <b>and</b> saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled expression, <b>and</b> rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake. “It's sunlight <b>and</b> bright day, right enough,” he said. “I thought that Elves were all for moon <b>and</b> stars: <b>but</b> this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell <b>of</b>. I feel as if I was inside a song. if you take my meaning.”
<br>   Haldir looked at them, <b>and</b> he seemed indeed <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> both thought <b>and</b> word. He smiled. “You feel <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim,” he said. “Would <b>it</b> please you <b>to</b> climb with me up Cerin Amroth?”
<br>   They followed him as he stepped lightly up <b>the</b> grass-clad slopes. Though he walked <b>and</b> breathed, <b>and</b> about him living leaves <b>and</b> flowers were stirred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade <b>or</b> change <b>or</b> fall <b>into</b> forgetfulness. When he had gone <b>and</b> passed again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer world, still Frodo <b>the</b> wanderer from <b>the</b> Shire would walk there, upon <b>the</b> grass among elanor <b>and</b> niphredil in fair Lothl?rien.
<br>   They entered <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> white trees. As they did so <b>the</b> South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth <b>and</b> sighed among <b>the</b> branches. Frodo stood still, hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, <b>and</b> sea-birds crying whose race had perished from <b>the</b> earth.
<br>   Haldir had gone <b>on</b> <b>and</b> was now climbing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high flet. As Frodo prepared <b>to</b> follow him, he laid his hand upon <b>the</b> tree beside <b>the</b> ladder: never before had he been so suddenly <b>and</b> so keenly aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feel <b>and</b> texture <b>of</b> a tree's skin <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> life within <b>it</b>. He felt a delight in wood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> touch <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, neither as forester nor as carpenter; <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> delight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living tree itself.
<br>   As he stepped out at last upon <b>the</b> lofty platform, Haldir took his hand <b>and</b> turned him toward <b>the</b> South. “Look this way first! “he said.
<br>   Frodo looked <b>and</b> saw, still at some distance, a hill <b>of</b> many mighty trees, <b>or</b> a city <b>of</b> green towers: which <b>it</b> was he could not tell. Out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that <b>the</b> power <b>and</b> light came that held all <b>the</b> land in sway. He longed suddenly <b>to</b> fly like a bird <b>to</b> rest in <b>the</b> green city. Then he looked eastward <b>and</b> saw all <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien running down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pale gleam <b>of</b> Anduin, <b>the</b> Great River. He lifted his eyes across <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> light went out, <b>and</b> he was back again in <b>the</b> world he knew. Beyond <b>the</b> river <b>the</b> land appeared flat <b>and</b> empty, formless <b>and</b> vague, until far away <b>it</b> rose again like a wall, dark <b>and</b> drear. The sun that lay <b>on</b> Lothl?rien had <b>no</b> power <b>to</b> enlighten <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> that distant height.
<br>   “There lies <b>the</b> fastness <b>of</b> Southern Mirkwood,” said Haldir. “It is clad in a forest <b>of</b> dark fir, where <b>the</b> trees strive one against another <b>and</b> their branches rot <b>and</b> wither. In <b>the</b> midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long <b>the</b> hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now <b>it</b> is inhabited again, <b>and</b> with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over <b>it</b> <b>of</b> late. In this high place you may see <b>the</b> two powers that are opposed one <b>to</b> another; <b>and</b> ever they strive now in thought, <b>but</b> whereas <b>the</b> light perceives <b>the</b> very heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness, its own secret has not been discovered. Not yet.” He turned <b>and</b> climbed swiftly down, <b>and</b> they followed him.
<br>   At <b>the</b> hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still <b>and</b> silent as a tree; <b>but</b> in his hand was a small golden bloom <b>of</b> elanor, <b>and</b> a light was in his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: <b>and</b> as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For <b>the</b> grim years were removed from <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> Aragorn, <b>and</b> he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall <b>and</b> fair; <b>and</b> he spoke words in <b>the</b> Elvish tongue <b>to</b> one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, nam?ri?! he said, <b>and</b> then he drew a breath, <b>and</b> returning out <b>of</b> his thought he looked at Frodo <b>and</b> smiled.
<br>   “Here is <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> Elvendom <b>on</b> earth,” he said, “<b>and</b> here my heart dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond <b>the</b> dark roads that we still must tread, you <b>and</b> I. Come with me! “And taking Frodo's hand in his, he left <b>the</b> hill <b>of</b> Cerin Amroth <b>and</b> came there never again as living man.

<br>Chapter 7
<br>THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL
<br>   
<br>   The sun was sinking behind <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadows were deepening in <b>the</b> woods, when they went <b>on</b> again. Their paths now went <b>into</b> thickets where <b>the</b> dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath <b>the</b> trees as they walked, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves uncovered their silver lamps.
<br>   Suddenly they came out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open again <b>and</b> found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked <b>by</b> a few early stars. There was a wide treeless space before them, running in a great circle <b>and</b> bending away <b>on</b> either hand. Beyond <b>it</b> was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> grass upon its brink was green, as if <b>it</b> glowed still in memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun that had gone. Upon <b>the</b> further side there rose <b>to</b> a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in all <b>the</b> land. Their height could not be guessed, <b>but</b> they stood up in <b>the</b> twilight like living towers. In their, many-tiered branches <b>and</b> amid their ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green <b>and</b> gold <b>and</b> silver. Haldir turned towards <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “Welcome <b>to</b> Caras Galadhon! “he said. “Here is <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim where dwell <b>the</b> Lord Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> L?rien. But we cannot enter here, for <b>the</b> gates do not look northward. We must go round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> way is not short, for <b>the</b> city is great.”
<br>   There was a road paved with white stone running <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fosse. Along this they went westward, with <b>the</b> city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left; <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> night deepened more lights sprang forth, until all <b>the</b> hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last <b>to</b> a white bridge, <b>and</b> crossing found <b>the</b> great gates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city: they faced south-west, set between <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encircling wall that here overlapped, <b>and</b> they were tall <b>and</b> strong, <b>and</b> hung with many lamps.
<br>   Haldir knocked <b>and</b> spoke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gates opened soundlessly; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> guards Frodo could see <b>no</b> sign. The travellers passed within, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gates shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> passing quickly through <b>it</b> they entered <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trees. No folk could they see, nor hear any feet upon <b>the</b> paths; <b>but</b> there were many voices, about them, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> air above. Far away up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill they could hear <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> singing falling from <b>on</b> high like soft rain upon leaves.
<br>   They went along many paths <b>and</b> climbed many stairs, until they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high places <b>and</b> saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. It was lit <b>by</b> silver lamps that swung from <b>the</b> boughs <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> fell <b>into</b> a basin <b>of</b> silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawn there stood <b>the</b> mightiest <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> trees; its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, <b>and</b> up <b>it</b> towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds <b>of</b> leaves. Beside <b>it</b> a broad white ladder stood, <b>and</b> at its foot three Elves were seated. They sprang up as <b>the</b> travellers approached, <b>and</b> Frodo saw that they were tall <b>and</b> clad in grey mail, <b>and</b> from their shoulders hung long white cloaks.
<br>   “Here dwell Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel,” said Haldir. “It is their wish that you should ascend <b>and</b> speak with them.”
<br>   One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-wardens then blew a clear note <b>on</b> a small horn, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was answered three times from far above. “I will go first,” said Haldir. “Let Frodo come next <b>and</b> with him Legolas. The others may follow as they wish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed <b>to</b> such stairs, <b>but</b> you may rest upon <b>the</b> way.”
<br>   As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some <b>on</b> one side, some <b>on</b> another, <b>and</b> some set about <b>the</b> bole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, so that <b>the</b> ladder passed through them. At a great height above <b>the</b> ground he came <b>to</b> a wide talan, like <b>the</b> deck <b>of</b> a great ship. On <b>it</b> was built a house, so large that almost <b>it</b> would have served for a hall <b>of</b> Men upon <b>the</b> earth. He entered behind Haldir, <b>and</b> found that he was in a chamber <b>of</b> oval shape, in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> which grew <b>the</b> trunk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great mallorn, now tapering towards its crown, <b>and</b> yet making still a pillar <b>of</b> wide girth.
<br>   The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green <b>and</b> silver <b>and</b> its roof <b>of</b> gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs beneath <b>the</b> bole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>and</b> canopied <b>by</b> a living bough there sat, side <b>by</b> side, Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel. They stood up <b>to</b> greet their guests, after <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall they were, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>no</b> less tall than <b>the</b> Lord; <b>and</b> they were grave <b>and</b> beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady was <b>of</b> deep gold, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord Celeborn was <b>of</b> silver long <b>and</b> bright; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> age was upon them, unless <b>it</b> were in <b>the</b> depths <b>of</b> their eyes; for these were keen as lances in <b>the</b> starlight, <b>and</b> yet profound, <b>the</b> wells <b>of</b> deep memory.
<br>   Haldir led Frodo before them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lord welcomed him in his own tongue. The Lady Galadriel said <b>no</b> word <b>but</b> looked long upon his face.
<br>   “Sit now beside my chair, Frodo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire! “said Celeborn. “When all have come we will speak together.”
<br>   Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> companions he greeted courteously <b>by</b> name as they entered. “Welcome Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn! “he said. “It is eight <b>and</b> thirty years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world outside since you came <b>to</b> this land; <b>and</b> those years lie heavy <b>on</b> you. But <b>the</b> end is near, for good <b>or</b> ill. Here lay aside your burden for a while!”
<br>   “Welcome son <b>of</b> Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from <b>the</b> North.”
<br>   “Welcome Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?in! It is long indeed since we saw one <b>of</b> Durin's folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May <b>it</b> be a sign that though <b>the</b> world is now dark better days are at hand, <b>and</b> that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.” Gimli bowed low.
<br>   When all <b>the</b> guests were seated before his chair <b>the</b> Lord looked at them again. “Here there are eight,” he said. “Nine were <b>to</b> set out: so said <b>the</b> messages. But maybe there has been some change <b>of</b> counsel that we have not heard. Elrond is far away, <b>and</b> darkness gathers between us, <b>and</b> all this year <b>the</b> shadows have grown longer.”
<br>   “Nay, there was <b>no</b> change <b>of</b> counsel,” said <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel speaking for <b>the</b> first time. Her voice was clear <b>and</b> musical, <b>but</b> deeper than woman's wont. “Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey set out with <b>the</b> Company, <b>but</b> he did not pass <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired <b>to</b> speak with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within <b>the</b> fences <b>of</b> Lothl?rien: a grey mist is about him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> his feet <b>and</b> <b>of</b> his mind are hidden from me.”
<br>   “Alas! “said Aragorn. “Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey fell <b>into</b> shadow. He remained in Moria <b>and</b> did not escape.”
<br>   At these words all <b>the</b> Elves in <b>the</b> hall cried aloud in grief <b>and</b> amazement. “These are evil tidings,” said Celeborn, “<b>the</b> most evil that have been spoken here in long years full <b>of</b> grievous deeds.” He turned <b>to</b> Haldir. “Why has nothing <b>of</b> this been told <b>to</b> me before? “he asked in <b>the</b> Elven-tongue.
<br>   “We have not spoken <b>to</b> Haldir <b>of</b> our deeds <b>or</b> our purpose,” said Legolas. “At first we were weary <b>and</b> danger was too close behind <b>and</b> afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fair paths <b>of</b> L?rien.”
<br>   “Yet our grief is great <b>and</b> our loss cannot be mended,” said Frodo. “Gandalf was our guide, <b>and</b> he led us through Moria; <b>and</b> when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, <b>and</b> he fell.”
<br>   “Tell us now <b>the</b> full tale! “said Celeborn:
<br>   Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon <b>the</b> pass <b>of</b> Caradhras, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> days that followed; <b>and</b> he spoke <b>of</b> Balin <b>and</b> his book, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fight in <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> narrow bridge, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Terror. “An evil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient World <b>it</b> seemed, such as I have never seen before,” said Aragorn. “It was both a shadow <b>and</b> a flame, strong <b>and</b> terrible.”
<br>   “It was a Balrog <b>of</b> Morgoth,” said Legolas; “<b>of</b> all elf-banes <b>the</b> most deadly, save <b>the</b> One who sits in <b>the</b> Dark Tower.”
<br>   “Indeed I saw upon <b>the</b> bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams l saw Durin's Bane,” said Gimli in a low voice, <b>and</b> dread was in his eyes.
<br>   “Alas! “said Celeborn. “We long have feared that under Caradhras a terror slept. But had I known that <b>the</b> Dwarves had stirred up this evil in Moria again, l would have forbidden you <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> northern borders, you <b>and</b> all that went with you. And if <b>it</b> were possible, one would say that at <b>the</b> last Gandalf fell from wisdom <b>into</b> folly, going needlessly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net <b>of</b> Moria.”
<br>   “He would be rash indeed that said that thing,” said Galadriel gravely. “Needless were none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeds <b>of</b> Gandalf in life. Those that followed him knew not his mind <b>and</b> cannot report his full purpose. But however <b>it</b> may be with <b>the</b> guide, <b>the</b> followers are blameless. Do not repent <b>of</b> your welcome <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long <b>and</b> far from Lothl?rien, who <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim, even Celeborn <b>the</b> Wise, would pass nigh <b>and</b> would not wish <b>to</b> look upon their ancient home, though <b>it</b> had become an abode <b>of</b> dragons?
<br>   “Dark is <b>the</b> water <b>of</b> Kheled-z?ram, <b>and</b> cold are <b>the</b> springs <b>of</b> Kibil-n?la, <b>and</b> fair were <b>the</b> many-pillared halls <b>of</b> Khazad-d?m in Elder Days before <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> mighty kings beneath <b>the</b> stone.” She looked upon Gimli, who sat glowering <b>and</b> sad, <b>and</b> she smiled. And <b>the</b> Dwarf, hearing <b>the</b> names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up <b>and</b> met her eyes; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he looked suddenly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> an enemy <b>and</b> saw there love <b>and</b> understanding. Wonder came <b>into</b> his face, <b>and</b> then he smiled in answer.
<br>   He rose clumsily <b>and</b> bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: “Yet more fair is <b>the</b> living land <b>of</b> L?rien, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel is above all <b>the</b> jewels that lie beneath <b>the</b> earth!”
<br>   There was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. “I did not know that your plight was so evil,” he said. “Let Gimli forget my harsh words: I spoke in <b>the</b> trouble <b>of</b> my heart. I will do what I can <b>to</b> aid you, each according <b>to</b> his wish <b>and</b> need, <b>but</b> especially that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little folk who bears <b>the</b> burden.”
<br>   “Your quest is known <b>to</b> us,” said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. “But we will not here speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b> more openly. Yet not in vain will <b>it</b> prove, maybe, that you came <b>to</b> this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed. For <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim is accounted <b>the</b> wisest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Middle-earth, <b>and</b> a giver <b>of</b> gifts beyond <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> kings. He has dwelt in <b>the</b> West since <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> dawn, <b>and</b> I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Nargothrond <b>or</b> Gondolin I passed over <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> together through ages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world we have fought <b>the</b> long defeat.
<br>   “I <b>it</b> was who first summoned <b>the</b> White Council. And if my designs had not gone amiss, <b>it</b> would have been governed <b>by</b> Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey, <b>and</b> then mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I will not give you counsel, saying do this, <b>or</b> do that. For not in doing <b>or</b> contriving, nor in choosing between this course <b>and</b> another, can I avail; <b>but</b> only in knowing what was <b>and</b> is, <b>and</b> in part also what shall be. But this I will say <b>to</b> you: your Quest stands upon <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a knife. Stray <b>but</b> a little <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will fail, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ruin <b>of</b> all. Yet hope remains while all <b>the</b> Company is true.”
<br>   And with that word she held them with her eyes, <b>and</b> in silence looked searchingly at each <b>of</b> them in turn. None save Legolas <b>and</b> Aragorn could long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed <b>and</b> hung his head.
<br>   At length <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, <b>and</b> she smiled. “Do not let your hearts be troubled,” she said. “Tonight you shall sleep in peace.” Then they sighed <b>and</b> felt suddenly weary, as those who have been questioned long <b>and</b> deeply, though <b>no</b> words had been spoken openly.
<br>   “Go now! “said Celeborn. “You are worn with sorrow <b>and</b> much toil. Even if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge in this City, until you were healed <b>and</b> refreshed. Now you shall rest, <b>and</b> we will not speak <b>of</b> your further road for a while.”
<br>   That night <b>the</b> Company slept upon <b>the</b> ground, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among <b>the</b> trees near <b>the</b> fountain, <b>and</b> in <b>it</b> they laid soft couches; then speaking words <b>of</b> peace with fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while <b>the</b> travellers talked <b>of</b> their night before in <b>the</b> tree-tops, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> their day's journey, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady; for they had not yet <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> look further back.
<br>   “What did you blush for, Sam? “said Pippin. “You soon broke down. Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope <b>it</b> was nothing worse than a wicked plot <b>to</b> steal one <b>of</b> my blankets.”
<br>   “I never thought <b>no</b> such thing,” answered Sam, in <b>no</b> mood for jest. “If you want <b>to</b> know, I felt as if I hadn't got nothing <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> I didn't like <b>it</b>. She seemed <b>to</b> be looking inside me <b>and</b> asking me what I would do if she gave me <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> flying back home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>to</b> a nice little hole with-with a bit <b>of</b> garden <b>of</b> my own.”
<br>   “That's funny,” said Merry. “Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, only well, I don't think I'll say any more,” he ended lamely.
<br>   All <b>of</b> them, <b>it</b> seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full <b>of</b> fear that lay ahead, <b>and</b> something that he greatly desired: clear before his mind <b>it</b> lay, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> get <b>it</b> he had only <b>to</b> turn aside from <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> Quest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> war against Sauron <b>to</b> others.
<br>   “And <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me, too,” said Gimli, “that my choice would remain secret <b>and</b> known only <b>to</b> myself.”
<br>   “To me <b>it</b> seemed exceedingly strange,” said Boromir. “Maybe <b>it</b> was only a test, <b>and</b> she thought <b>to</b> read our thoughts for her own good purpose; <b>but</b> almost I should have said that she was tempting us, <b>and</b> offering what she pretended <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> power <b>to</b> give. It need not be said that I refused <b>to</b> listen. The Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith are true <b>to</b> their word.” But what he thought that <b>the</b> Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell.
<br>   And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with questions. “She held you long in her gaze, Ring-bearer,” he said.
<br>   “Yes,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> whatever came <b>into</b> my mind then I will keep there.”
<br>   “Well, have a care! “said Boromir. “I do not feel too sure <b>of</b> this Elvish Lady <b>and</b> her purposes.”
<br>   “Speak <b>no</b> evil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel! “said Aragorn sternly. “You know not what you say. There is in her <b>and</b> in this land <b>no</b> evil, unless a man bring <b>it</b> hither himself. Then let him beware! But tonight I shall sleep without fear for <b>the</b> first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep deep, <b>and</b> forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body <b>and</b> in heart.” He cast himself down upon his couch <b>and</b> fell at once <b>into</b> a long sleep.
<br>   The others soon did <b>the</b> same, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> sound <b>or</b> dream disturbed their slumber. When they woke they found that <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> day was broad upon <b>the</b> lawn before <b>the</b> pavilion. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fountain rose <b>and</b> fell glittering in <b>the</b> sun.
<br>   They remained some days in Lothl?rien, so far as they could tell <b>or</b> remember. All <b>the</b> while that they dwelt there <b>the</b> sun shone clear, save for a gentle rain that fell at times, <b>and</b> passed away leaving all things fresh <b>and</b> clean. The air was cool <b>and</b> soft, as if <b>it</b> were early spring, yet they felt about them <b>the</b> deep <b>and</b> thoughtful quiet <b>of</b> winter. It seemed <b>to</b> them that they did little <b>but</b> eat <b>and</b> drink <b>and</b> rest, <b>and</b> walk among <b>the</b> trees; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was enough.
<br>   They had not seen <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady again, <b>and</b> they had little speech with <b>the</b> Elven-folk; for few <b>of</b> these knew <b>or</b> would use <b>the</b> Westron tongue. Haldir had bidden them farewell <b>and</b> gone back again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, where great watch was now kept since <b>the</b> tidings <b>of</b> Moria that <b>the</b> Company had brought. Legolas was away much among <b>the</b> Galadhrim, <b>and</b> after <b>the</b> first night he did not sleep with <b>the</b> other companions, though he returned <b>to</b> eat <b>and</b> talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he went abroad in <b>the</b> land, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others wondered at this change.
<br>   Now as <b>the</b> companions sat <b>or</b> walked together they spoke <b>of</b> Gandalf, <b>and</b> all that each had known <b>and</b> seen <b>of</b> him came clear before their minds. As they were healed <b>of</b> hurt <b>and</b> weariness <b>of</b> body <b>the</b> grief <b>of</b> their loss grew more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, <b>and</b> knew that they were making songs <b>of</b> lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name among <b>the</b> sweet sad words that they could not understand.
<br>   Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang <b>the</b> Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For so they loved <b>to</b> call him. But if Legolas was with <b>the</b> Company, he would not interpret <b>the</b> songs for them, saying that he had not <b>the</b> skill, <b>and</b> that for him <b>the</b> grief was still too near, a matter for tears <b>and</b> not yet for song.
<br>   It was Frodo who first put something <b>of</b> his sorrow <b>into</b> halting words. He was seldom moved <b>to</b> make song <b>or</b> rhyme; even in Rivendell he had listened <b>and</b> had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him. But now as he sat beside <b>the</b> fountain in L?rien <b>and</b> heard about him <b>the</b> voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair <b>to</b> him; yet when he tried <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Sam only snatches remained, faded as a handful <b>of</b> withered leaves.
<br>   
<br>When evening in <b>the</b> Shire was grey
<br>his footsteps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hill were heard;
<br>before <b>the</b> dawn he went away
<br><b>on</b> journey long without a word.
<br>
<br>From Wilderland <b>to</b> Western shore,
<br>from northern waste <b>to</b> southern hill,
<br>through dragon-lair <b>and</b> hidden door
<br><b>and</b> darkling woods he walked at will.
<br>
<br>With Dwarf <b>and</b> Hobbit, Elves <b>and</b> Men,
<br>with mortal <b>and</b> immortal folk,
<br>with bird <b>on</b> bough <b>and</b> beast in den,
<br>in their own secret tongues he spoke.
<br>
<br>A deadly sword, a healing hand,
<br>a back that bent beneath its load;
<br>a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,
<br>a weary pilgrim <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road.
<br>
<br>A lord <b>of</b> wisdom throned he sat,
<br>swift in anger, quick <b>to</b> laugh;
<br>an old man in a battered hat
<br>who leaned upon a thorny staff.
<br>
<br>He stood upon <b>the</b> bridge alone
<br><b>and</b> Fire <b>and</b> Shadow both defied;
<br>his staff was broken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone,
<br>in Khazad-d?m his wisdom died.
<br>   
<br>   “Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! “said Sam.
<br>   “No, I am afraid not,” said Frodo. “But that is <b>the</b> best I can do yet.”
<br>   “Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you'll say a word about his fireworks,” said Sam. “Something like this:
<br>   
<br>The finest rockets ever seen:
<br>they burst in stars <b>of</b> blue <b>and</b> green,
<br><b>or</b> after thunder golden showers
<br>came falling like a rain <b>of</b> flowers.
<br>   
<br>   Though that doesn't do them justice <b>by</b> a long road.”
<br>   “No, I'll leave that <b>to</b> you, Sam. Or perhaps <b>to</b> Bilbo. But-well. I can't talk <b>of</b> <b>it</b> any more. I can't bear <b>to</b> think <b>of</b> bringing <b>the</b> news <b>to</b> him.”
<br>   One evening Frodo <b>and</b> Sam were walking together in <b>the</b> cool twilight. Both <b>of</b> them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> parting had fallen: he knew somehow that <b>the</b> time was very near when he must leave Lothl?rien.
<br>   “What do you think <b>of</b> Elves now, Sam? “he said. “I asked you <b>the</b> same question once before-<b>it</b> seems a very long while ago; <b>but</b> you have seen more <b>of</b> them since then.”
<br>   “I have indeed! “said Sam. “And I reckon there's Elves <b>and</b> Elves. They're all elvish enough, <b>but</b> they're not all <b>the</b> same. Now these folk aren't wanderers <b>or</b> homeless, <b>and</b> seem a bit nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> likes <b>of</b> us: they seem <b>to</b> belong here, more even than Hobbits do in <b>the</b> Shire. Whether they've made <b>the</b> land, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> land's made them, <b>it</b>'s hard <b>to</b> say, if you take my meaning. It's wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems <b>to</b> be going <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> nobody seems <b>to</b> want <b>it</b> <b>to</b>. If there's any magic about, <b>it</b>'s right down deep, where I can't lay my hands <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, in a manner <b>of</b> speaking.”
<br>   “You can see <b>and</b> feel <b>it</b> everywhere,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Well,” said Sam, “you can't see nobody working <b>it</b>. No fireworks like poor Gandalf used <b>to</b> show. I wonder we don't see nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady in all these days. I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things, if she had a mind. I'd dearly love <b>to</b> see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo!”
<br>   “I wouldn't,” said Frodo. “I am content. And I don't miss Gandalf's fireworks, <b>but</b> his bushy eyebrows, <b>and</b> his quick temper, <b>and</b> his voice.”
<br>   “You're right,” said Sam. “And don't think I'm finding fault. I've often wanted <b>to</b> see a bit <b>of</b> magic like what <b>it</b> tells <b>of</b> in old tales, <b>but</b> I've never heard <b>of</b> a better land than this. It's like being at home <b>and</b> <b>on</b> a holiday at <b>the</b> same time, if you understand me. I don't want <b>to</b> leave. All <b>the</b> same, I'm beginning <b>to</b> feel that if we've got <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>, then we'd best get <b>it</b> over.
<br>   “It's <b>the</b> job that's never started as takes longest <b>to</b> finish, as my old gaffer used <b>to</b> say. And I don't reckon that these folk can do much more <b>to</b> help us, magic <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. It's when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.”
<br>   “I am afraid that's only too true, Sam,” said Frodo. “Yet I hope very much that before we leave we shall see <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves again.”
<br>   Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer <b>to</b> their words, <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall <b>and</b> white <b>and</b> fair she walked beneath <b>the</b> trees. She spoke <b>no</b> word, <b>but</b> beckoned <b>to</b> them.
<br>   Turning aside, she led them toward <b>the</b> southern slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>of</b> Caras Galadhon, <b>and</b> passing through a high green hedge they came <b>into</b> an enclosed garden. No trees grew there, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> lay open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky. The evening star had risen <b>and</b> was shining with white fire above <b>the</b> western woods. Down a long flight <b>of</b> steps <b>the</b> Lady went <b>into</b> a deep green hollow, through which ran murmuring <b>the</b> silver stream that issued from <b>the</b> fountain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill. At <b>the</b> bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree, stood a basin <b>of</b> silver. wide <b>and</b> shallow, <b>and</b> beside <b>it</b> stood a silver ewer.
<br>   With water from <b>the</b> stream Galadriel filled <b>the</b> basin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brim, <b>and</b> breathed <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> water was still again she spoke. “Here is <b>the</b> Mirror <b>of</b> Galadriel,” she said. “I have brought you here so that you may look in <b>it</b>, if you will.”
<br>   The air was very still, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dell was dark, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elf-lady beside him was tall <b>and</b> pale. “What shall we look for, <b>and</b> what shall we see? “asked Frodo, filled with awe.
<br>   “Many things I can command <b>the</b> Mirror <b>to</b> reveal,” she answered, “<b>and</b> <b>to</b> some I can show what they desire <b>to</b> see. But <b>the</b> Mirror will also show things unbidden, <b>and</b> those are often stranger <b>and</b> more profitable than things which we wish <b>to</b> behold. What you will see, if you leave <b>the</b> Mirror free <b>to</b> work, I cannot tell. For <b>it</b> shows things that were, <b>and</b> things that are, things that yet may be. But which <b>it</b> is that he sees, even <b>the</b> wisest cannot always tell. Do you wish <b>to</b> look?”
<br>   Frodo did not answer.
<br>   “And you? “she said, turning <b>to</b> Sam. “For this is what your folk would call magic. I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; <b>and</b> they seem also <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> same word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. But this, if you will, is <b>the</b> magic <b>of</b> Galadriel. Did you not say that you wished <b>to</b> see Elf-magic?”
<br>   “I did,” said Sam, trembling a little between fear <b>and</b> curiosity. “I'll have a peep, Lady, if you're willing.”
<br>   “And I'd not mind a glimpse <b>of</b> what's going <b>on</b> at home,” he said in an aside <b>to</b> Frodo. “It seems a terrible long time that I've been away. But there, like as not I'll only see <b>the</b> stars, <b>or</b> something that I won't understand.”
<br>   “Like as not,” said <b>the</b> Lady with a gentle laugh. “But come, you shall look <b>and</b> see what you may. Do not touch <b>the</b> water!”
<br>   Sam climbed up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedestal <b>and</b> leaned over <b>the</b> basin. The water looked hard <b>and</b> dark. Stars were reflected in <b>it</b>.
<br>   “There's only stars, as I thought,” he said. Then he gave a low gasp, for <b>the</b> stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, <b>the</b> Mirror grew grey, <b>and</b> then clear. There was sun shining, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> trees were waving <b>and</b> tossing in <b>the</b> wind. But before Sam could make up his mind what <b>it</b> was that he saw, <b>the</b> light faded; <b>and</b> now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed <b>to</b> see himself going along a dim passage, <b>and</b> climbing an endless winding stair. It came <b>to</b> him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, <b>but</b> what <b>it</b> was he did not know. Like a dream <b>the</b> vision shifted <b>and</b> went back, <b>and</b> he saw <b>the</b> trees again. But this time they were not so close, <b>and</b> he could see what was going <b>on</b>: they were not waving in <b>the</b> wind, they were falling, crashing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground.
<br>   “Hi!” cried Sam in an outraged voice. “There's that Ted Sandyman a-cutting down trees as he shouldn't. They didn't ought <b>to</b> be felled: <b>it</b>'s that avenue beyond <b>the</b> Mill that shades <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> Bywater. I wish I could get at Ted, <b>and</b> I'd fell him!”
<br>   But now Sam noticed that <b>the</b> Old Mill had vanished, <b>and</b> a large red-brick building was being put up where <b>it</b> had stood. Lots <b>of</b> folk were busily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed <b>to</b> cloud <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mirror.
<br>   “There's some devilry at work in <b>the</b> Shire,” he said. “Elrond knew what he was about when he wanted <b>to</b> send Mr. Merry back.” Then suddenly Sam gave a cry <b>and</b> sprang away. “I can't stay here,” he said wildly. “I must go home. They've dug up Bagshot Row, <b>and</b> there's <b>the</b> poor old gaffer going down <b>the</b> Hill with his bits <b>of</b> things <b>on</b> a barrow. I must go home!”
<br>   “You cannot go home alone,” said <b>the</b> Lady. “You did not wish <b>to</b> go home without your master before you looked in <b>the</b> Mirror, <b>and</b> yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in <b>the</b> Shire. Remember that <b>the</b> Mirror shows many things, <b>and</b> not all have yet come <b>to</b> pass. Some never come <b>to</b> be, unless those that behold <b>the</b> visions turn aside from their path <b>to</b> prevent them. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide <b>of</b> deeds.”
<br>   Sam sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>and</b> put his head in his hands. “I wish I had never come here, <b>and</b> I don't want <b>to</b> see <b>no</b> more magic,” he said <b>and</b> fell silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. “No, I'll go home <b>by</b> <b>the</b> long road with Mr. Frodo, <b>or</b> not at all,” he said. “But I hope I do get back some day. If what I've seen turns out true, somebody's going <b>to</b> catch <b>it</b> hot!”
<br>   “Do you now wish <b>to</b> look, Frodo? “said <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel. “You did not wish <b>to</b> see Elf-magic <b>and</b> were content.”
<br>   “Do you advise me <b>to</b> look? “asked Frodo.
<br>   “No,” she said. “I do not counsel you one way <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other. I am not a counsellor. You may learn something, <b>and</b> whether what you see be fair <b>or</b> evil, that may be profitable, <b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> may not. Seeing is both good <b>and</b> perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage <b>and</b> wisdom enough for <b>the</b> venture, <b>or</b> I would not have brought you here. Do as you will!”
<br>   “I will look,” said Frodo, <b>and</b> he climbed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pedestal <b>and</b> bent over <b>the</b> dark water. At once <b>the</b> Mirror cleared <b>and</b> he saw a twilit land. Mountains loomed dark in <b>the</b> distance against a pale sky. A long grey road wound back out <b>of</b> sight. Far away a figure came slowly down <b>the</b> road, faint <b>and</b> small at first, <b>but</b> growing larger <b>and</b> clearer as <b>it</b> approached. Suddenly Frodo realized that <b>it</b> reminded him <b>of</b> Gandalf. He almost called aloud <b>the</b> wizard's name, <b>and</b> then he saw that <b>the</b> figure was clothed not in grey <b>but</b> in white, in a white that shone faintly in <b>the</b> dusk; <b>and</b> in its hand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see <b>no</b> face, <b>and</b> presently <b>the</b> figure turned aside round a bend in <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> went out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mirror's view. Doubt came <b>into</b> Frodo's mind: was this a vision <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>on</b> one <b>of</b> his many lonely journeys long ago, <b>or</b> was <b>it</b> Saruman?
<br>   The vision now changed. Brief <b>and</b> small <b>but</b> very vivid he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered with disordered papers; rain was beating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windows.
<br>   Then there was a pause, <b>and</b> after <b>it</b> many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew <b>to</b> be parts <b>of</b> a great history in which he had become involved. The mist cleared <b>and</b> he saw a sight which he had never seen before <b>but</b> knew at once: <b>the</b> Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose <b>and</b> raged in a great storm. Then he saw against <b>the</b> Sun, sinking blood-red <b>into</b> a wrack <b>of</b> clouds, <b>the</b> black outline <b>of</b> a tall ship with torn sails riding up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, <b>but</b> now <b>it</b> was morning again, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water rippled with light, <b>and</b> a banner bearing <b>the</b> emblem <b>of</b> a white tree shone in <b>the</b> sun. A smoke as <b>of</b> fire <b>and</b> battle arose, <b>and</b> again <b>the</b> sun went down in a burning red that faded <b>into</b> a grey mist; <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It vanished, <b>and</b> Frodo sighed <b>and</b> prepared <b>to</b> draw away.
<br>   But suddenly <b>the</b> Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> sight, <b>and</b> Frodo looked <b>into</b> emptiness. In <b>the</b> black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew. until <b>it</b> filled nearly all <b>the</b> Mirror. So terrible was <b>it</b> that Frodo stood rooted, unable <b>to</b> cry out <b>or</b> <b>to</b> withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, <b>but</b> was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful <b>and</b> intent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black slit <b>of</b> its pupil opened <b>on</b> a pit, a window <b>into</b> nothing.
<br>   Then <b>the</b> Eye began <b>to</b> rove, searching this way <b>and</b> that; <b>and</b> Frodo knew with certainty <b>and</b> horror that among <b>the</b> many things that <b>it</b> sought he himself was one. But he also knew that <b>it</b> could not see him-not yet, not unless he willed <b>it</b>. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great stone, <b>and</b> his head was dragged downwards. The Mirror seemed <b>to</b> be growing hot <b>and</b> curls <b>of</b> steam were rising from <b>the</b> water. He was slipping forward.
<br>   “Do not touch <b>the</b> water!” said <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel softly. The vision faded, <b>and</b> Frodo found that he was looking at <b>the</b> cool stars twinkling in <b>the</b> silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over <b>and</b> looked at <b>the</b> Lady.
<br>   “I know what <b>it</b> was that you last saw,” she said; “for that is also in my mind. Do not be afraid! But do not think that only <b>by</b> singing amid <b>the</b> trees, nor even <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slender arrows <b>of</b> elven-bows, is this land <b>of</b> Lothl?rien maintained <b>and</b> defended against its Enemy. I say <b>to</b> you, Frodo, that even as I speak <b>to</b> you, I perceive <b>the</b> Dark Lord <b>and</b> know his mind, <b>or</b> all <b>of</b> his mind that concerns <b>the</b> Elves. And he gropes ever <b>to</b> see me <b>and</b> my thought. But still <b>the</b> door is closed!”
<br>   She lifted up her white arms, <b>and</b> spread out her hands towards <b>the</b> East in a gesture <b>of</b> rejection <b>and</b> denial. E?rendil, <b>the</b> Evening Star, most beloved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, shone clear above. So bright was <b>it</b> that <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-lady cast a dim shadow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger; <b>it</b> glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light, <b>and</b> a white stone in <b>it</b> twinkled as if <b>the</b> Even-star had come down <b>to</b> rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at <b>the</b> ring with awe; for suddenly <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he understood.
<br>   “Yes,” she said, divining his thought, “<b>it</b> is not permitted <b>to</b> speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> Elrond could not do so. But <b>it</b> cannot be hidden from <b>the</b> Ring-bearer, <b>and</b> one who has seen <b>the</b> Eye. Verily <b>it</b> is in <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien upon <b>the</b> finger <b>of</b> Galadriel that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three remains. This is Nenya, <b>the</b> Ring <b>of</b> Adamant, <b>and</b> I am its keeper.
<br>   “He suspects, <b>but</b> he does not know—not yet. Do you not see now wherefore your coming is <b>to</b> us as <b>the</b> footstep <b>of</b> Doom? For if you fail, then we are laid bare <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, <b>and</b> Lothl?rien will fade, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tides <b>of</b> Time will sweep <b>it</b> away. We must depart <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West, <b>or</b> dwindle <b>to</b> a rustic folk <b>of</b> dell <b>and</b> cave, slowly <b>to</b> forget <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be forgotten.”
<br>   Frodo bent his head. “And what do you wish? “he said at last.
<br>   “That what should be shall be,” she answered. “The love <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves for their land <b>and</b> their works is deeper than <b>the</b> deeps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, <b>and</b> their regret is undying <b>and</b> cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will cast all away rather than submit <b>to</b> Sauron: for they know him now. For <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> Lothl?rien you are not answerable <b>but</b> only for <b>the</b> doing <b>of</b> your own task. Yet I could wish, were <b>it</b> <b>of</b> any avail, that <b>the</b> One Ring had never been wrought, <b>or</b> had remained for ever lost.”
<br>   “You are wise <b>and</b> fearless <b>and</b> fair, Lady Galadriel,” said Frodo. “I will give you <b>the</b> One Ring, if you ask for <b>it</b>. It is too great a matter for me.”
<br>   Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. “Wise <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel may be,” she said, “yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are you revenged for my testing <b>of</b> your heart at our first meeting. You begin <b>to</b> see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired <b>to</b> ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should <b>the</b> Great Ring come <b>into</b> my hands, <b>and</b> behold! <b>it</b> was brought within my grasp. The evil that was devised long ago works <b>on</b> in many ways, whether Sauron himself stands <b>or</b> falls. Would not that have been a noble deed <b>to</b> set <b>to</b> <b>the</b> credit <b>of</b> his Ring, if I had taken <b>it</b> <b>by</b> force <b>or</b> fear from my guest?
<br>   “And now at last <b>it</b> comes. You will give me <b>the</b> Ring freely! In place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, <b>but</b> beautiful <b>and</b> terrible as <b>the</b> Morning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Night! Fair as <b>the</b> Sea <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Snow upon <b>the</b> Mountain! Dreadful as <b>the</b> Storm <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lightning! Stronger than <b>the</b> foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. All shall love me <b>and</b> despair!”
<br>   She lifted up her hand <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her alone <b>and</b> left all else dark. She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, <b>and</b> beautiful beyond enduring, terrible <b>and</b> worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light faded, <b>and</b> suddenly she laughed again, <b>and</b> lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft <b>and</b> sad.
<br>   “I pass <b>the</b> test,” she said. “I will diminish, <b>and</b> go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> remain Galadriel.”
<br>   They stood for a long while in silence. At length <b>the</b> Lady spoke again. “Let us return! “she said. “In <b>the</b> morning you must depart for now we have chosen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tides <b>of</b> fate are flowing.”
<br>   “I would ask one thing before we go,” said Frodo, “a thing which I often meant <b>to</b> ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted <b>to</b> wear <b>the</b> One Ring: why cannot I see all <b>the</b> others <b>and</b> know <b>the</b> thoughts <b>of</b> those that wear them?”
<br>   “You have not tried,” she said. “Only thrice have you set <b>the</b> Ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf tell you that <b>the</b> rings give power according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> measure <b>of</b> each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need <b>to</b> become far stronger, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> train your will <b>to</b> <b>the</b> domination <b>of</b> others. Yet even so, as Ring-bearer <b>and</b> as one that has borne <b>it</b> <b>on</b> finger <b>and</b> seen that which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw <b>the</b> Eye <b>of</b> him that holds <b>the</b> Seven <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nine. And did you not see <b>and</b> recognize <b>the</b> ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring? “she asked turning again <b>to</b> Sam.
<br>   “No, Lady,” he answered. “To tell you <b>the</b> truth, I wondered what you were talking about. I saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you'd take his Ring. You'd put things <b>to</b> rights. You'd stop them digging up <b>the</b> gaffer <b>and</b> turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.”
<br>   “I would,” she said. “That is how <b>it</b> would begin. But <b>it</b> would not stop with that, alas! We will not speak more <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Let us go!”
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>FAREWELL TO L?RIEN
<br>
<br>   That night <b>the</b> Company was again summoned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chamber <b>of</b> Celeborn, <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn spoke <b>of</b> their departure.
<br>   “Now is <b>the</b> time,” he said, “when those who wish <b>to</b> continue <b>the</b> Quest must harden their hearts <b>to</b> leave this land. Those who <b>no</b> longer wish <b>to</b> go forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay <b>or</b> go, none can be sure <b>of</b> peace. For we are come now <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> doom. Here those who wish may await <b>the</b> oncoming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hour till either <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world lie open again. <b>or</b> we summon them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last need <b>of</b> L?rien. Then they may return <b>to</b> their own lands, <b>or</b> else go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long home <b>of</b> those that fall in battle.”
<br>   There was a silence. “They all resolved <b>to</b> go forward,” said Galadriel looking in their eyes.
<br>   “As for me,” said Boromir, “my way home lies onward <b>and</b> not back.”
<br>   “That is true,” said Celeborn, “<b>but</b> is all this Company going with you <b>to</b> Minas Tirith?”
<br>   “We have not decided our course,” said Aragorn. “Beyond Lothl?rien I do not know what Gandalf intended <b>to</b> do. Indeed I do not think that even he had any clear purpose.”
<br>   “Maybe not,” said Celeborn, “yet when you leave this land, you can <b>no</b> longer forget <b>the</b> Great River. As some <b>of</b> you know well, <b>it</b> cannot be crossed <b>by</b> travellers with baggage between L?rien <b>and</b> Gondor, save <b>by</b> boat. And are not <b>the</b> bridges <b>of</b> Osgiliath broken down <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> landings held now <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Enemy?
<br>   “On which side will you journey? The way <b>to</b> Minas Tirith lies upon this side, upon <b>the</b> west; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> straight road <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quest lies east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, upon <b>the</b> darker shore. Which shore will you now take?”
<br>   “If my advice is heeded, <b>it</b> will be <b>the</b> western shore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> Minas Tirith,” answered Boromir. “But I am not <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company.” The others said nothing, <b>and</b> Aragorn looked doubtful <b>and</b> troubled.
<br>   “I see that you do not yet know what <b>to</b> do,” said Celeborn. “It is not my part <b>to</b> choose for you; <b>but</b> I will help you as I may. There are some among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know <b>the</b> swift Forest River; <b>and</b> Boromir <b>of</b> Gondor; <b>and</b> Aragorn <b>the</b> traveller.”
<br>   “And one Hobbit! “cried Merry. “Not all <b>of</b> us look <b>on</b> boats as wild horses. My people live <b>by</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine.”
<br>   “That is well,” said Celeborn. “Then I will furnish your Company with boats. They must be small <b>and</b> light, for if you go far <b>by</b> water, there are places where you will be forced <b>to</b> carry them. You will come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rapids <b>of</b> Sarn Gebir, <b>and</b> maybe at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great falls <b>of</b> Rauros where <b>the</b> River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; <b>and</b> there are other perils. Boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while. Yet they will not give you counsel: in <b>the</b> end you must leave them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> turn west-<b>or</b> east.”
<br>   Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift <b>of</b> boats comforted him much, not least because there would now be <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> decide his course for some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, <b>it</b> seemed better <b>to</b> float down <b>the</b> broad tide <b>of</b> Anduin <b>to</b> meet them than <b>to</b> plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses, <b>or</b> worse, <b>and</b> not all <b>the</b> dangers that he had survived made him think better <b>of</b> them.
<br>   “All shall be prepared for you <b>and</b> await you at <b>the</b> haven before noon tomorrow,” said Celeborn. “I will send my people <b>to</b> you in <b>the</b> morning <b>to</b> help you make ready for <b>the</b> journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night <b>and</b> untroubled sleep.”
<br>   “Good night, my friends! “said Galadriel. “Sleep in peace! Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road tonight. Maybe <b>the</b> paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though you do not see them. Good night!”
<br>   The Company now took their leave <b>and</b> returned <b>to</b> their pavilion. Legolas went with them, for this was <b>to</b> be their last night in Lothl?rien, <b>and</b> in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Galadriel they wished <b>to</b> take counsel together.
<br>   For a long time they debated what they should do, <b>and</b> how <b>it</b> would be best <b>to</b> attempt <b>the</b> fulfilling <b>of</b> their purpose with <b>the</b> Ring: <b>but</b> they came <b>to</b> <b>no</b> decision. It was plain that most <b>of</b> them desired <b>to</b> go first <b>to</b> Minas Tirith, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> escape at least for a while from <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. They would have been willing <b>to</b> follow a leader over <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> Mordor; <b>but</b> Frodo spoke <b>no</b> word, <b>and</b> Aragorn was still divided in his mind.
<br>   His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been <b>to</b> go with Boromir, <b>and</b> with his sword help <b>to</b> deliver Gondor. For he believed that <b>the</b> message <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dreams was a summons, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> hour had come at last when <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Elendil should come forth <b>and</b> strive with Sauron for <b>the</b> mastery. But in Moria <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> Gandalf had been laid <b>on</b> him; <b>and</b> he knew that he could not now forsake <b>the</b> Ring, if Frodo refused in <b>the</b> end <b>to</b> go with Boromir. And yet what help could he <b>or</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company give <b>to</b> Frodo, save <b>to</b> walk blindly with him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness?
<br>   “I shall go <b>to</b> Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for <b>it</b> is my duty,” said Boromir; <b>and</b> after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes fixed <b>on</b> Frodo, as if he was trying <b>to</b> read <b>the</b> Halfling's thoughts. At length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. “If you wish only <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> Ring,” he said, “then there is little use in war <b>and</b> weapons; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> armed might <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord, then <b>it</b> is folly <b>to</b> go without force <b>into</b> his domain; <b>and</b> folly <b>to</b> throw away.” He paused suddenly, as if he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. “It would be folly <b>to</b> throw lives away, I mean,” he ended. “It is a choice between defending a strong place <b>and</b> walking openly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> death. At least, that is how I see <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Frodo caught something new <b>and</b> strange in Boromir's glance, <b>and</b> he looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final words. It would be folly <b>to</b> throw away: what? The Ring <b>of</b> Power? He had said something like this at <b>the</b> Council, <b>but</b> then he had accepted <b>the</b> correction <b>of</b> Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, <b>but</b> he seemed deep in his own thought <b>and</b> made <b>no</b> sign that he had heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate ended. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were already asleep, <b>and</b> Sam was nodding. The night was growing old.
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning, as they were beginning <b>to</b> pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came <b>to</b> them <b>and</b> brought them many gifts <b>of</b> food <b>and</b> clothing for <b>the</b> journey. The food was mostly in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> very thin cakes, made <b>of</b> a meal that was baked a light brown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside, <b>and</b> inside was <b>the</b> colour <b>of</b> cream. Gimli took up one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cakes <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b> with a doubtful eye.
<br>   “Cram,” he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner <b>and</b> nibbled at <b>it</b>. His expression quickly changed, <b>and</b> he ate all <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cake with relish.
<br>   “No more, <b>no</b> more!” cried <b>the</b> Elves laughing. “You have eaten enough already for a long day's march.”
<br>   “I thought <b>it</b> was only a kind <b>of</b> cram, such as <b>the</b> Dale-men make for journeys in <b>the</b> wild,” said <b>the</b> Dwarf.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> is,” they answered. “But we call <b>it</b> lembas <b>or</b> waybread, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is more strengthening than any food made <b>by</b> Men, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is more pleasant than cram, <b>by</b> all accounts.”
<br>   “Indeed <b>it</b> is,” said Gimli. “Why <b>it</b> is better than <b>the</b> honey-cakes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beornings, <b>and</b> that is great praise, for <b>the</b> Beornings are <b>the</b> best bakers that I know <b>of</b>; <b>but</b> they are none too willing <b>to</b> deal out their cakes <b>to</b> travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts!”
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same, we bid you spare <b>the</b> food,” they said. “Eat little at a time, <b>and</b> only at need. For these things are given <b>to</b> serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken <b>and</b> left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveller <b>on</b> his feet for a day <b>of</b> long labour, even if he be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tall Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith.”
<br>   The Elves next unwrapped <b>and</b> gave <b>to</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>the</b> clothes they had brought. For each they had provided a hood <b>and</b> cloak, made according <b>to</b> his size, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light <b>but</b> warm silken stuff that <b>the</b> Galadhrim wove. It was hard <b>to</b> say <b>of</b> what colour they were: grey with <b>the</b> hue <b>of</b> twilight under <b>the</b> trees they seemed <b>to</b> be; <b>and</b> yet if they were moved, <b>or</b> set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, <b>or</b> brown as fallow fields <b>by</b> night, dusk-silver as water under <b>the</b> stars. Each cloak was fastened about <b>the</b> neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.
<br>   “Are these magic cloaks? “asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.
<br>   “I do not know what you mean <b>by</b> that,” answered <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves. “They are fair garments, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> web is good, for <b>it</b> was made in this land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf <b>and</b> branch, water <b>and</b> stone: they have <b>the</b> hue <b>and</b> beauty <b>of</b> all these things under <b>the</b> twilight <b>of</b> L?rien that we love; for we put <b>the</b> thought <b>of</b> all that we love <b>into</b> all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, <b>and</b> they will not turn shaft <b>or</b> blade. But they should serve you well: they are light <b>to</b> wear, <b>and</b> warm enough <b>or</b> cool enough at need. And you will find them a great aid in keeping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight <b>of</b> unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among <b>the</b> stones <b>or</b> <b>the</b> trees. You are indeed high in <b>the</b> favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady! For she herself <b>and</b> her maidens wove this stuff; <b>and</b> never before have we clad strangers in <b>the</b> garb <b>of</b> our own people.”
<br>   After their morning meal <b>the</b> Company said farewell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for <b>it</b> was a fair place, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> had become like home <b>to</b> them, though they could not count <b>the</b> days <b>and</b> nights that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at <b>the</b> white water in <b>the</b> sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over <b>the</b> green grass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glade. Frodo greeted him with delight.
<br>   “I have returned from <b>the</b> Northern Fences,” said <b>the</b> Elf, “<b>and</b> I am sent now <b>to</b> be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full <b>of</b> vapour <b>and</b> clouds <b>of</b> smoke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mountains are troubled. There are noises in <b>the</b> deeps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. If any <b>of</b> you had thought <b>of</b> returning northwards <b>to</b> your homes, you would not have been able <b>to</b> pass that way. But come! Your path now goes south.”
<br>   As they walked through Caras Galadhon <b>the</b> green ways were empty; <b>but</b> in <b>the</b> trees above them many voices were murmuring <b>and</b> singing. They themselves went silently. At last Haldir led them down <b>the</b> southward slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> they came again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great gate hung with lamps, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white bridge; <b>and</b> so they passed out <b>and</b> left <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves. Then they turned away from <b>the</b> paved road <b>and</b> took a path that went off <b>into</b> a deep thicket <b>of</b> mallorn-trees, <b>and</b> passed <b>on</b>, winding through rolling woodlands <b>of</b> silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards <b>and</b> eastwards, towards <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River.
<br>   They had gone some ten miles <b>and</b> noon was at hand when they came <b>on</b> a high green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. Before them lay a long lawn <b>of</b> shining grass, studded with golden elanor that glinted in <b>the</b> sun. The lawn ran out <b>into</b> a narrow tongue between bright margins: <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>and</b> west <b>the</b> Silverlode flowed glittering; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> east <b>the</b> Great River rolled its broad waters, deep <b>and</b> dark. On <b>the</b> further shores <b>the</b> woodlands still marched <b>on</b> southwards as far as <b>the</b> eye could see, <b>but</b> all <b>the</b> banks were bleak <b>and</b> bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> L?rien.
<br>   On <b>the</b> bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, at some distance up from <b>the</b> meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streams, there was a hythe <b>of</b> white stones <b>and</b> white wood. By <b>it</b> were moored many boats <b>and</b> barges. Some were brightly painted, <b>and</b> shone with silver <b>and</b> gold <b>and</b> green, <b>but</b> most were either white <b>or</b> grey. Three small grey boats had been made ready for <b>the</b> travellers, <b>and</b> in these <b>the</b> Elves stowed their goods. And they added also coils <b>of</b> rope, three <b>to</b> each boat. Slender they looked, <b>but</b> strong, silken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> touch, grey <b>of</b> hue like <b>the</b> elven-cloaks.
<br>   “What are these? “asked Sam, handling one that lay upon <b>the</b> greensward.
<br>   “Ropes indeed! “answered an Elf from <b>the</b> boats. “Never travel far without a rope! And one that is long <b>and</b> strong <b>and</b> light. Such are these. They may be a help in many needs.”
<br>   “You don't need <b>to</b> tell me that! “said Sam. “I came without any <b>and</b> I've been worried ever since. But I was wondering what these were made <b>of</b>, knowing a bit about rope-making: <b>it</b>'s in <b>the</b> family as you might say.”
<br>   “They are made <b>of</b> hithlain,” said <b>the</b> Elf, “<b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> time now <b>to</b> instruct you in <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> their making. Had we known that this craft delighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May <b>it</b> serve you well!”
<br>   “Come! “said Haldir. “All is now ready for you. Enter <b>the</b> boats! But take care at first!”
<br>   “Heed <b>the</b> words! “said <b>the</b> other Elves. “These boats are light-built, <b>and</b> they are crafty <b>and</b> unlike <b>the</b> boats <b>of</b> other folk. They will not sink, lade them as you will; <b>but</b> they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves <b>to</b> stepping in <b>and</b> out, here where there is a landing-place, before you set off downstream.”
<br>   The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, <b>and</b> Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, <b>and</b> Pippin in another; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> third were Legolas <b>and</b> Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goods <b>and</b> packs were stowed. The boats were moved <b>and</b> steered with short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready Aragorn led them <b>on</b> a trial up <b>the</b> Silverlode. The current was swift <b>and</b> they went forward slowly. Sam sat in <b>the</b> bows, clutching <b>the</b> sides, <b>and</b> looking back wistfully <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore. The sunlight glittering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond <b>the</b> green field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tongue, <b>the</b> trees drew down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river's brink. Here <b>and</b> there golden leaves tossed <b>and</b> floated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rippling stream. The air was very bright <b>and</b> still, <b>and</b> there was a silence, except for <b>the</b> high distant song <b>of</b> larks.
<br>   They turned a sharp bend in <b>the</b> river, <b>and</b> there, sailing proudly down <b>the</b> stream toward them, they saw a swan <b>of</b> great size. The water rippled <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, <b>and</b> its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down <b>the</b> river as <b>it</b> drew nearer; <b>and</b> suddenly they perceived that <b>it</b> was a ship, wrought <b>and</b> carved with elven-skill in <b>the</b> likeness <b>of</b> a bird. Two elves clad in white steered <b>it</b> with black paddles. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel sat Celeborn, <b>and</b> behind him stood Galadriel, tall <b>and</b> white; a circlet <b>of</b> golden flowers was in her hair, <b>and</b> in her hand she held a harp, <b>and</b> she sang. Sad <b>and</b> sweet was <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> her voice in <b>the</b> cool clear air:
<br>   
<br>I sang <b>of</b> leaves, <b>of</b> leaves <b>of</b> gold, <b>and</b> leaves <b>of</b> gold there grew:
<br>Of wind I sang, a wind there came <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> branches blew.
<br>Beyond <b>the</b> Sun, beyond <b>the</b> Moon, <b>the</b> foam was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sea,
<br>And <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strand <b>of</b> Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> stars <b>of</b> Ever-eve in Eldamar <b>it</b> shone,
<br>In Eldamar beside <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> Elven Tirion.
<br>There long <b>the</b> golden leaves have grown upon <b>the</b> branching years,
<br>While here beyond <b>the</b> Sundering Seas now fall <b>the</b> Elven-tears.
<br>O L?rien! The Winter comes, <b>the</b> bare <b>and</b> leafless Day;
<br>The leaves are falling in <b>the</b> stream, <b>the</b> River flows away.
<br>O L?rien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore
<br>And in a fading crown have twined <b>the</b> golden elanor.
<br>But if <b>of</b> ships I now should sing, what ship would come <b>to</b> me,
<br>What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?
<br>   
<br>   Aragorn stayed his boat as <b>the</b> Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended her song <b>and</b> greeted them. “We have come <b>to</b> bid you our last farewell,” she said, “<b>and</b> <b>to</b> speed you with blessings from our land.”
<br>   “Though you have been our guests,” said Celeborn, “you have not yet eaten with us, <b>and</b> we bid you, therefore, <b>to</b> a parting feast, here between <b>the</b> flowing waters that will bear you far from L?rien.”
<br>   The Swan passed <b>on</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hythe, <b>and</b> they turned their boats <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b>. There in <b>the</b> last end <b>of</b> Egladil upon <b>the</b> green grass <b>the</b> parting feast was held; <b>but</b> Frodo ate <b>and</b> drank little, heeding only <b>the</b> beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>and</b> her voice. She seemed <b>no</b> longer perilous <b>or</b> terrible, nor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed <b>to</b> him, as <b>by</b> men <b>of</b> later days Elves still at times are seen: present <b>and</b> yet remote, a living vision <b>of</b> that which has already been left far behind <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flowing streams <b>of</b> Time.
<br>   After they had eaten <b>and</b> drunk, sitting upon <b>the</b> grass, Celeborn spoke <b>to</b> them again <b>of</b> their journey, <b>and</b> lifting his hand he pointed south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods beyond <b>the</b> Tongue.
<br>   “As you go down <b>the</b> water,” he said, “you will find that <b>the</b> trees will fail, <b>and</b> you will come <b>to</b> a barren country. There <b>the</b> River flows in stony vale amid high moors, until at last after many leagues <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tall island <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There <b>it</b> casts its arms about <b>the</b> steep shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isle, <b>and</b> falls then with a great noise <b>and</b> smoke over <b>the</b> cataracts <b>of</b> Rauros down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Nindalf, <b>the</b> Wetwang as <b>it</b> is called in your tongue. That is a wide region <b>of</b> sluggish fen where <b>the</b> stream becomes tortuous <b>and</b> much divided. There <b>the</b> Entwash flows in <b>by</b> many mouths from <b>the</b> Forest <b>of</b> Fangorn in <b>the</b> west. About that stream, <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River, lies Rohan. On <b>the</b> further side are <b>the</b> bleak hills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil. The wind blows from <b>the</b> East there, for they look out over <b>the</b> Dead Marshes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Noman-lands <b>to</b> Cirith Gorgor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black gates <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   “Boromir, <b>and</b> any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Great River above Rauros <b>and</b> cross <b>the</b> Entwash before <b>it</b> finds <b>the</b> marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk becoming entangled in <b>the</b> Forest <b>of</b> Fangorn. That is a strange land, <b>and</b> is now little known. But Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn doubtless do not need this warning.”
<br>   “Indeed we have heard <b>of</b> Fangorn in Minas Tirith,” said Boromir. “But what I have heard seems <b>to</b> me for <b>the</b> most part old wives” tales, such as we tell <b>to</b> our children. All that lies north <b>of</b> Rohan is now <b>to</b> us so far away that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> our realm; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is now many lives <b>of</b> men since any <b>of</b> us visited <b>it</b>, <b>to</b> prove <b>or</b> disprove <b>the</b> legends that have come down from distant years.
<br>   “I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, <b>but</b> I have never crossed <b>it</b> northwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through <b>the</b> Gap <b>by</b> <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains, <b>and</b> crossed <b>the</b> Isen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood <b>into</b> Northerland. A long <b>and</b> wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I reckoned <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at <b>the</b> fording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood. After that journey, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road I have trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall find a way through Rohan, <b>and</b> Fangorn too, if need be.”
<br>   “Then I need say <b>no</b> more,” said Celeborn. “But do not despise <b>the</b> lore that has come down from distant years; for oft <b>it</b> may chance that old wives keep in memory word <b>of</b> things that once were needful for <b>the</b> wise <b>to</b> know.”
<br>   Now Galadriel rose from <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> taking a cup from one <b>of</b> her maidens she filled <b>it</b> with white mead <b>and</b> gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Celeborn.
<br>   “Now <b>it</b> is time <b>to</b> drink <b>the</b> cup <b>of</b> farewell,” she said. “Drink, Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon, <b>and</b> already our evening draweth nigh.”
<br>   Then she brought <b>the</b> cup <b>to</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, <b>and</b> bade them drink <b>and</b> farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them <b>to</b> sit again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> chairs were set for her <b>and</b> for Celeborn. Her maidens stood silent about her, <b>and</b> a while she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke again.
<br>   “We have drunk <b>the</b> cup <b>of</b> parting,” she said, “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadows fall between us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim now offer you in memory <b>of</b> Lothl?rien.” Then she called <b>to</b> each in turn.
<br>   “Here is <b>the</b> gift <b>of</b> Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> your Company,” she said <b>to</b> Aragorn, <b>and</b> she gave him a sheath that had been made <b>to</b> fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery <b>of</b> flowers <b>and</b> leaves wrought <b>of</b> silver <b>and</b> gold, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> were set in elven runes formed <b>of</b> many gems <b>the</b> name And?ril <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lineage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword.
<br>   “The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained <b>or</b> broken even in defeat,” she said. “But is there aught else that you desire <b>of</b> me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may be that we shall not meet again, unless <b>it</b> be far hence upon a road that has <b>no</b> returning.”
<br>   And Aragorn answered: “Lady, you know all my desire, <b>and</b> long held in keeping <b>the</b> only treasure that I seek. Yet <b>it</b> is not yours <b>to</b> give me, even if you would; <b>and</b> only through darkness shall I come <b>to</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,” said Galadriel; “for <b>it</b> was left in my care <b>to</b> be given <b>to</b> you, should you pass through this land.” Then she lifted from her lap a great stone <b>of</b> a clear green, set in a silver brooch that was wrought in <b>the</b> likeness <b>of</b> an eagle with outspread wings; <b>and</b> as she held <b>it</b> up <b>the</b> gem flashed like <b>the</b> sun shining through <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> spring. “This stone I gave <b>to</b> Celebr?an my daughter, <b>and</b> she <b>to</b> hers; <b>and</b> now <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> you as a token <b>of</b> hope. In this hour take <b>the</b> name that was foretold for you, Elessar, <b>the</b> Elfstone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elendil!”
<br>   Then Aragorn took <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> pinned <b>the</b> brooch upon his breast, <b>and</b> those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall <b>and</b> kingly he stood, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> them that many years <b>of</b> toil had fallen from his shoulders. “For <b>the</b> gifts that you have given me I thank you,” he said, “O Lady <b>of</b> L?rien <b>of</b> whom were sprung Celebr?an <b>and</b> Arwen Evenstar. What praise could I say more?”
<br>   The Lady bowed her head, <b>and</b> she turned then <b>to</b> Boromir, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> him she gave a belt <b>of</b> gold; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> Merry <b>and</b> Pippin she gave small silver belts, each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she gave a bow such as <b>the</b> Galadhrim used, longer <b>and</b> stouter than <b>the</b> bows <b>of</b> Mirkwood, <b>and</b> strung with a string <b>of</b> elf-hair. With <b>it</b> went a quiver <b>of</b> arrows.
<br>   “For you little gardener <b>and</b> lover <b>of</b> trees,” she said <b>to</b> Sam, “I have only a small gift.” She put <b>into</b> his hand a little box <b>of</b> plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon <b>the</b> lid. “Here is set G for Galadriel,” she said; “<b>but</b> also <b>it</b> may stand for garden in your tongue. In this box there is earth from my orchard, <b>and</b> such blessing as Galadriel has still <b>to</b> bestow is upon <b>it</b>. It will not keep you <b>on</b> your road, nor defend you against any peril; <b>but</b> if you keep <b>it</b> <b>and</b> see your home again at last, then perhaps <b>it</b> may reward you. Though you should find all barren <b>and</b> laid waste, there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel, <b>and</b> catch a glimpse far off <b>of</b> L?rien, that you have seen only in our winter. For our spring <b>and</b> our summer are gone <b>by</b>, <b>and</b> they will never be seen <b>on</b> earth again save in memory.”
<br>   Sam went red <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ears <b>and</b> muttered something inaudible, as he clutched <b>the</b> box <b>and</b> bowed as well as he could.
<br>   “And what gift would a Dwarf ask <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves? “said Galadriel turning <b>to</b> Gimli.
<br>   “None, Lady,” answered Gimli. “It is enough for me <b>to</b> have seen <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> have heard her gentle words.”
<br>   “Hear all ye Elves! “she cried <b>to</b> those about her. “Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping <b>and</b> ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?in, you desire something that I could give? Name <b>it</b>, I bid you! You shall not be <b>the</b> only guest without a gift.”
<br>   “There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,” said Gimli, bowing low <b>and</b> stammering. “Nothing, unless <b>it</b> might be—unless <b>it</b> is permitted <b>to</b> ask, nay, <b>to</b> name a single strand <b>of</b> your hair, which surpasses <b>the</b> gold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth as <b>the</b> stars surpass <b>the</b> gems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me <b>to</b> name my desire.”
<br>   The Elves stirred <b>and</b> murmured with astonishment, <b>and</b> Celeborn gazed at <b>the</b> Dwarf in wonder, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Lady smiled. “It is said that <b>the</b> skill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues “she said; “yet that is not true <b>of</b> Gimli. For none have ever made <b>to</b> me a request so bold <b>and</b> yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him <b>to</b> speak? But tell me, what would you do with such a gift?”
<br>   “Treasure <b>it</b>, Lady,” he answered, “in memory <b>of</b> your words <b>to</b> me at our first meeting. And if ever I return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smithies <b>of</b> my home, <b>it</b> shall be set in imperishable crystal <b>to</b> be an heirloom <b>of</b> my house, <b>and</b> a pledge <b>of</b> good will between <b>the</b> Mountain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wood until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> days.”
<br>   Then <b>the</b> Lady unbraided one <b>of</b> her long tresses, <b>and</b> cut off three golden hairs, <b>and</b> laid them in Gimli's hand. “These words shall go with <b>the</b> gift,” she said. “I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand lies darkness, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other only hope. But if hope should not fail, then I say <b>to</b> you, Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?in, that your hands shall flow with gold, <b>and</b> yet over you gold shall have <b>no</b> dominion.
<br>   “And you, Ring-bearer,” she said, turning <b>to</b> Frodo. “I come <b>to</b> you last who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.” She held up a small crystal phial: <b>it</b> glittered as she moved <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> rays <b>of</b> white light sprang from her hand. “In this phial,” she said, “is caught <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> E?rendil's star, set amid <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> my fountain. It will shine still brighter when night is about you. May <b>it</b> be a light <b>to</b> you in dark places, when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel <b>and</b> her Mirror!”
<br>   Frodo took <b>the</b> phial, <b>and</b> for a moment as <b>it</b> shone between them, he saw her again standing like a queen, great <b>and</b> beautiful, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> longer terrible. He bowed, <b>but</b> found <b>no</b> words <b>to</b> say.
<br>   Now <b>the</b> Lady arose, <b>and</b> Celeborn led them back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hythe. A yellow noon lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tongue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water glittered with silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in <b>the</b> boats as before. Crying farewell, <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> L?rien with long grey poles thrust them out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flowing stream, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rippling waters bore them slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving <b>or</b> speaking. On <b>the</b> green bank near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tongue <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel stood alone <b>and</b> silent. As they passed her they turned <b>and</b> their eyes watched her slowly floating away from them. For so <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> them: L?rien was slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing <b>on</b> <b>to</b> forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon <b>the</b> margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grey <b>and</b> leafless world.
<br>   Even as they gazed, <b>the</b> Silverlode passed out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> currents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River, <b>and</b> their boats turned <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> speed southwards. Soon <b>the</b> white form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady was small <b>and</b> distant. She shone like a window <b>of</b> glass upon a far hill in <b>the</b> westering sun, <b>or</b> as a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in <b>the</b> lap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land. Then <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farewell, <b>and</b> far <b>but</b> piercing-clear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following wind came <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> her voice singing. But now she sang in <b>the</b> ancient tongue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves beyond <b>the</b> Sea, <b>and</b> he did not understand <b>the</b> words: fair was <b>the</b> music, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> did not comfort him.
<br>   Yet as is <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory, <b>and</b> long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: <b>the</b> language was that <b>of</b> Elven-song <b>and</b> spoke <b>of</b> things little known <b>on</b> Middle-earth.
<br>

<br>   
<br>   “Ah! like gold fall <b>the</b> leaves in <b>the</b> wind, long years numberless as <b>the</b> wings <b>of</b> trees! The long years have passed like swift draughts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweet mead in lofty halls beyond <b>the</b> West, beneath <b>the</b> blue vaults <b>of</b> Varda wherein <b>the</b> stars tremble in <b>the</b> song <b>of</b> her voice, holy <b>and</b> queenly. Who now shall refill <b>the</b> cup for me? For now <b>the</b> Kindler, Varda, <b>the</b> Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stars, from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, <b>and</b> all paths are drowned deep in shadow; <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> a grey country darkness lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foaming waves between us, <b>and</b> mist covers <b>the</b> jewels <b>of</b> Calacirya for ever. Now lost, lost <b>to</b> those from <b>the</b> East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find <b>it</b>. Farewell! “Varda is <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> that Lady whom <b>the</b> Elves in these lands <b>of</b> exile name Elbereth.
<br>   Suddenly <b>the</b> River swept round a bend, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> banks rose upon either side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> L?rien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came again.
<br>   The travellers now turned their faces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> journey; <b>the</b> sun was before them, <b>and</b> their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. Gimli wept openly.
<br>   “I have looked <b>the</b> last upon that which was fairest,” he said <b>to</b> Legolas his companion. “Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless <b>it</b> be her gift.” He put his hand <b>to</b> his breast.
<br>   “Tell me, Legolas, why did I come <b>on</b> this Quest? Little did I know where <b>the</b> chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in <b>the</b> dark was <b>the</b> danger that I feared, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I known <b>the</b> danger <b>of</b> light <b>and</b> joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this parting, even if I were <b>to</b> go this night straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord. Alas for Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?in!”
<br>   “Nay! “said Legolas. “Alas for us all! And for all that walk <b>the</b> world in these after-days. For such is <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>it</b>: <b>to</b> find <b>and</b> lose, as <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> those whose boat is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> running stream. But I count you blessed, Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?in: for your loss you suffer <b>of</b> your own free will, <b>and</b> you might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> least reward that you shall have is that <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> Lothl?rien shall remain ever clear <b>and</b> unstained in your heart, <b>and</b> shall neither fade nor grow stale.”
<br>   “Maybe,” said Gimli; “<b>and</b> I thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what <b>the</b> heart desires. That is only a mirror, be <b>it</b> clear as Kheled-z?ram. Or so says <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> Gimli <b>the</b> Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I have heard that for them memory is more like <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waking world than <b>to</b> a dream. Not so for Dwarves.
<br>   “But let us talk <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Look <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boat! She is too low in <b>the</b> water with all this baggage, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great River is swift. I do not wish <b>to</b> drown my grief in cold water.” He took up a paddle, <b>and</b> steered towards <b>the</b> western bank, following Aragorn's boat ahead, which had already moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle stream.
<br>   So <b>the</b> Company went <b>on</b> their long way, down <b>the</b> wide hurrying waters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, <b>and</b> they could not see any glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lands behind. The breeze died away <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River flowed without a sound. No voice <b>of</b> bird broke <b>the</b> silence. The sun grew misty as <b>the</b> day grew old, until <b>it</b> gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl. Then <b>it</b> faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West, <b>and</b> dusk came early, followed <b>by</b> a grey <b>and</b> starless night. Far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark quiet hours they floated <b>on</b>, guiding their boats under <b>the</b> overhanging shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western woods. Great trees passed <b>by</b> like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through <b>the</b> mist down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water. It was dreary <b>and</b> cold. Frodo sat <b>and</b> listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faint lap <b>and</b> gurgle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River fretting among <b>the</b> tree-roots <b>and</b> driftwood near <b>the</b> shore, until his head nodded <b>and</b> he fell <b>into</b> an uneasy sleep.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>THE GREAT RIVER
<br>
<br>   Frodo was roused <b>by</b> Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, under tall grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woodlands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River, Anduin. He had slept <b>the</b> night away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey <b>of</b> morning was dim among <b>the</b> bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand.
<br>   They started again before <b>the</b> day was broad. Not that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company were eager <b>to</b> hurry southwards: they were content that <b>the</b> decision, which they must make at latest when they came <b>to</b> Rauros <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead; <b>and</b> they let <b>the</b> River bear them <b>on</b> at its own pace, having <b>no</b> desire <b>to</b> hasten towards <b>the</b> perils that lay beyond, whichever course they took in <b>the</b> end. Aragorn let them drift with <b>the</b> stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness <b>to</b> come. But he insisted that at least they should start early each day <b>and</b> journey <b>on</b> far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, <b>and</b> he feared that <b>the</b> Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in L?rien.
<br>   Nonetheless they saw <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> an enemy that day, nor <b>the</b> next. The dull grey hours passed without event. As <b>the</b> third day <b>of</b> their voyage wore <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lands changed slowly: <b>the</b> trees thinned <b>and</b> then failed altogether. On <b>the</b> eastern bank <b>to</b> their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up <b>and</b> away toward <b>the</b> sky; brown <b>and</b> withered they looked, as if fire had passed over them, leaving <b>no</b> living blade <b>of</b> green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree <b>or</b> a bold stone <b>to</b> relieve <b>the</b> emptiness. They had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brown Lands that lay, vast <b>and</b> desolate, between Southern Mirkwood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil. What pestilence <b>or</b> war <b>or</b> evil deed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.
<br>   Upon <b>the</b> west <b>to</b> their right <b>the</b> land was treeless also, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was flat, <b>and</b> in many places green with wide plains <b>of</b> grass. On this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River they passed forests <b>of</b> great reeds, so tall that they shut out all view <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, as <b>the</b> little boats went rustling <b>by</b> along their fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent <b>and</b> tossed in <b>the</b> light cold airs, hissing softly <b>and</b> sadly. Here <b>and</b> there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses <b>of</b> rolling meads, <b>and</b> far beyond them hills in <b>the</b> sunset, <b>and</b> away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> sight a dark line, where marched <b>the</b> southernmost ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains.
<br>   There was <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> living moving things, save birds. Of these there were many: small fowl whistling <b>and</b> piping in <b>the</b> reeds, <b>but</b> they were seldom seen. Once <b>or</b> twice <b>the</b> travellers heard <b>the</b> rush <b>and</b> whine <b>of</b> swan-wings, <b>and</b> looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along <b>the</b> sky.
<br>   “Swans! “said Sam. “And mighty big ones too!”
<br>   “Yes,” said Aragorn, “<b>and</b> they are black swans.”
<br>   “How wide <b>and</b> empty <b>and</b> mournful all this country looks! “said Frodo. “I always imagined that as one journeyed south <b>it</b> got warmer <b>and</b> merrier, until winter was left behind for ever.”
<br>   “But we have not journeyed far south yet,” answered Aragorn. “It is still winter, <b>and</b> we are far from <b>the</b> sea. Here <b>the</b> world is cold until <b>the</b> sudden spring, <b>and</b> we may yet have snow again. Far away down in <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Belfalas, <b>to</b> which Anduin runs, <b>it</b> is warm <b>and</b> merry, maybe, <b>or</b> would be <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southfarthing away in your Shire, hundreds <b>of</b> long miles yonder. You are looking now south-west across <b>the</b> north plains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riddermark, Rohan <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Limlight that runs down from Fangorn <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> Great River. That is <b>the</b> north boundary <b>of</b> Rohan; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> old all that lay between Limlight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rohirrim. It is a rich <b>and</b> pleasant land, <b>and</b> its grass has <b>no</b> rival; <b>but</b> in these evil days folk do not dwell <b>by</b> <b>the</b> River <b>or</b> ride often <b>to</b> its shores. Anduin is wide, yet <b>the</b> orcs can shoot their arrows far across <b>the</b> stream; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> late, <b>it</b> is said, they have dared <b>to</b> cross <b>the</b> water <b>and</b> raid <b>the</b> herds <b>and</b> studs <b>of</b> Rohan.”
<br>   Sam looked from bank <b>to</b> bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile before, as if they harboured secret eyes <b>and</b> lurking dangers; now he wished that <b>the</b> trees were still there. He felt that <b>the</b> Company was too naked, afloat in little open boats in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> shelterless lands, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> a river that was <b>the</b> frontier <b>of</b> war.
<br>   In <b>the</b> next day <b>or</b> two, as they went <b>on</b>, borne steadily southwards, this feeling <b>of</b> insecurity grew <b>on</b> all <b>the</b> Company. For a whole day they took <b>to</b> their paddles <b>and</b> hastened forward. The banks slid <b>by</b>. Soon <b>the</b> River broadened <b>and</b> grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon <b>the</b> east, <b>and</b> there were gravel-shoals in <b>the</b> water, so that careful steering was needed. The Brown Lands rose <b>into</b> bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air from <b>the</b> East. On <b>the</b> other side <b>the</b> meads had become rolling downs <b>of</b> withered grass amidst a land <b>of</b> fen <b>and</b> tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawns <b>and</b> fountains, <b>the</b> clear sun <b>and</b> gentle rains <b>of</b> Lothl?rien. There was little speech <b>and</b> <b>no</b> laughter in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boats. Each member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company was busy with his own thoughts.
<br>   The heart <b>of</b> Legolas was running under <b>the</b> stars <b>of</b> a summer night in some northern glade amid <b>the</b> beech-woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his mind, <b>and</b> wondering if <b>it</b> were fit <b>to</b> be wrought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> housing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady's gift. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin in <b>the</b> middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering <b>to</b> himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness <b>or</b> doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle <b>and</b> driving <b>the</b> boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in <b>the</b> bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up <b>to</b> believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined. He was cramped <b>and</b> miserable, having nothing <b>to</b> do <b>but</b> stare at <b>the</b> winter-lands crawling <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey water <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> him. Even when <b>the</b> paddles were in use they did not trust Sam with one.
<br>   As dusk drew down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth day, he was looking back over <b>the</b> bowed heads <b>of</b> Frodo <b>and</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following boats; he was drowsy <b>and</b> longed for camp <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feel <b>of</b> earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at <b>it</b> listlessly, then he sat up <b>and</b> rubbed his eyes; <b>but</b> when he looked again he could not see <b>it</b> any more.
<br>   That night they camped <b>on</b> a small eyot close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western bank. Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. “I had a funny dream an hour <b>or</b> two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,” he said. “Or maybe <b>it</b> wasn't a dream. Funny <b>it</b> was anyway.”
<br>   “Well, what was <b>it</b>? “said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle down until he had told his tale, whatever <b>it</b> was. “I haven't seen <b>or</b> thought <b>of</b> anything <b>to</b> make me smile since we left Lothl?rien.”
<br>   “It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if <b>it</b> wasn't a dream. And you had best hear <b>it</b>. It was like this: I saw a log with eyes!”
<br>   “The log's all right,” said Frodo. “There are many in <b>the</b> River. But leave out <b>the</b> eyes!”
<br>   “That I won't,” said Sam. “Twas <b>the</b> eyes as made me sit up, so <b>to</b> speak. I saw what I took <b>to</b> be a log floating along in <b>the</b> half-light behind Gimli's boat; <b>but</b> I didn't give much heed <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. Then <b>it</b> seemed as if <b>the</b> log was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we were all floating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stream together. Just then I saw <b>the</b> eyes: two pale sort <b>of</b> points, shiny-like, <b>on</b> a hump at <b>the</b> near end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> log. What's more, <b>it</b> wasn't a log, for <b>it</b> had paddle-feet, like a swan's almost, only they seemed bigger, <b>and</b> kept dipping in <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water.
<br>   “That's when I sat right up <b>and</b> rubbed my eyes, meaning <b>to</b> give a shout, if <b>it</b> was still there when I had rubbed <b>the</b> drowse out <b>of</b> my head. For <b>the</b> whatever-<b>it</b>-was was coming along fast now <b>and</b> getting close behind Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving <b>and</b> staring, <b>or</b> whether I came <b>to</b> my senses, I don't know. When I looked again, <b>it</b> wasn't there. Yet I think I caught a glimpse with <b>the</b> tail <b>of</b>-my eye, as <b>the</b> saying is, <b>of</b> something dark shooting under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank. I couldn't see <b>no</b> more eyes though.
<br>   “I said <b>to</b> myself: “dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,” I said: <b>and</b> I said <b>no</b> more just then. But I've been thinking since. <b>and</b> now I'm not so sure. What do you make <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, Mr. Frodo?”
<br>   “I should make nothing <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> a log <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dusk <b>and</b> sleep in your eyes Sam, said Frodo, if this was <b>the</b> first time that those eyes had been seen. But <b>it</b> isn't. I saw them away back north before we reached L?rien. And I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flet that night. Haldir saw <b>it</b> too. And do you remember <b>the</b> report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves that went after <b>the</b> orc-band?”
<br>   “Ah,” said Sam. “I do; <b>and</b> I remember more too. I don't like my thoughts; <b>but</b> thinking <b>of</b> one thing <b>and</b> another, <b>and</b> Mr. Bilbo's stories <b>and</b> all, I fancy I could put a name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creature, at a guess. A nasty name. Gollum, maybe?”
<br>   “Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,” said Frodo. “Ever since <b>the</b> night <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flet. I suppose he was lurking in Moria, <b>and</b> picked up our trail then; <b>but</b> I hoped that our stay in L?rien would throw him off <b>the</b> scent again. The miserable creature must have been hiding in <b>the</b> woods <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, watching us start off!”
<br>   “That's about <b>it</b>,” said Sam. “And we'd better be a bit more watchful ourselves, <b>or</b> we'll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one <b>of</b> these nights, if we ever wake up <b>to</b> feel anything. And that's what I was leading up <b>to</b>. No need <b>to</b> trouble Strider <b>or</b> <b>the</b> others tonight. I'll keep watch. I can sleep tomorrow, being <b>no</b> more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.”
<br>   “I might,” said Frodo, “<b>and</b> I might say “luggage with eyes". You shall watch; <b>but</b> only if you promise <b>to</b> wake me halfway towards morning, if nothing happens before then.”
<br>   In <b>the</b> dead hours Frodo came out <b>of</b> a deep dark sleep <b>to</b> find Sam shaking him. “It's a shame <b>to</b> wake you,” whispered Sam, “<b>but</b> that's what you said. There's nothing <b>to</b> tell, <b>or</b> not much. I thought I heard some soft plashing <b>and</b> a sniffing noise, a while back; <b>but</b> you hear a lot <b>of</b> such queer sounds <b>by</b> a river at night.”
<br>   He lay down, <b>and</b> Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, <b>and</b> fought off his sleep. Minutes <b>or</b> hours passed slowly, <b>and</b> nothing happened. Frodo was just yielding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temptation <b>to</b> lie down again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moored boats. A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as <b>it</b> shot out <b>and</b> grabbed <b>the</b> gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as they peered inside, <b>and</b> then they lifted <b>and</b> gazed up at Frodo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eyot. They were not more than a yard <b>or</b> two away, <b>and</b> Frodo heard <b>the</b> soft hiss <b>of</b> intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its sheath, <b>and</b> faced <b>the</b> eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was another hiss <b>and</b> a splash, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dark log-shape shot away downstream <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, <b>and</b> sat up`
<br>   “What is <b>it</b>? “he whispered, springing up <b>and</b> coming <b>to</b> Frodo. “I felt something in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword?”
<br>   “Gollum,” answered Frodo. “Or at least, so I guess.”
<br>   “Ah! “said Aragorn. “So you know about our little footpad, do you? He padded after us all through Moria <b>and</b> right down <b>to</b> Nimrodel. Since we took <b>to</b> boats, he has been lying <b>on</b> a log <b>and</b> paddling with hands <b>and</b> feet. I have tried <b>to</b> catch him once <b>or</b> twice at night; <b>but</b> he is slier than a fox, <b>and</b> as slippery as a fish. I hoped <b>the</b> river-voyage would beat him, <b>but</b> he is too clever a waterman.
<br>   “We shall have <b>to</b> try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, <b>and</b> I will keep watch for what is left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night. I wish I could lay my hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wretch. We might make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart from murder <b>by</b> night <b>on</b> his own account, he may put any enemy that is about <b>on</b> our track.”
<br>   The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again. After that <b>the</b> Company kept a sharp look-out, <b>but</b> they saw <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> Gollum while <b>the</b> voyage lasted. If he was still following, he was very wary <b>and</b> cunning. At Aragorn's bidding they paddled now for long spells, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> banks went swiftly <b>by</b>. But they saw little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, for they journeyed mostly <b>by</b> night <b>and</b> twilight, resting <b>by</b> day, <b>and</b> lying as hidden as <b>the</b> land allowed. In this way <b>the</b> time passed without event until <b>the</b> seventh day.
<br>   The weather was still grey <b>and</b> overcast, with wind from <b>the</b> East, <b>but</b> as evening drew <b>into</b> night <b>the</b> sky away westward cleared, <b>and</b> pools <b>of</b> faint light, yellow <b>and</b> pale green, opened under <b>the</b> grey shores <b>of</b> cloud. There <b>the</b> white rind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Moon could be seen glimmering in <b>the</b> remote lakes. Sam looked at <b>it</b> <b>and</b> puckered his brows.
<br>   The next day <b>the</b> country <b>on</b> either side began <b>to</b> change rapidly. The banks began <b>to</b> rise <b>and</b> grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes <b>of</b> thorn <b>and</b> sloe, tangled with brambles <b>and</b> creepers. Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs, <b>and</b> chimneys <b>of</b> grey weathered stone dark with ivy; <b>and</b> beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. They were drawing near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grey hill-country <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil, <b>the</b> southern march <b>of</b> Wilderland.
<br>   There were many birds about <b>the</b> cliffs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rock-chimneys, <b>and</b> all day high in <b>the</b> air flocks <b>of</b> birds had been circling, black against <b>the</b> pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched <b>the</b> flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> their voyage was now moving in <b>the</b> wilderness. Later as <b>the</b> sun was setting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Company was stirring <b>and</b> getting ready <b>to</b> start again, he descried a dark spot against <b>the</b> fading light: a great bird high <b>and</b> far off, now wheeling, now flying <b>on</b> slowly southwards.
<br>   “What is that, Legolas? “he asked, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern sky. “Is <b>it</b>, as I think. an eagle?”
<br>   “Yes.” said Legolas. “It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what that forebodes. It is far from <b>the</b> mountains.”
<br>   “We will not start until <b>it</b> is fully dark,” said Aragorn.
<br>   The eighth night <b>of</b> their journey came. It was silent <b>and</b> windless; <b>the</b> grey east wind had passed away. The thin crescent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon had fallen early <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pale sunset, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sky was clear above, <b>and</b> though far away in <b>the</b> South there were great ranges <b>of</b> cloud that still shone faintly, in <b>the</b> West stars glinted bright.
<br>   “Come! “said Aragorn. “We will venture one more journey <b>by</b> night. We are coming <b>to</b> reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River that I do not know well: for I have never journeyed <b>by</b> water in these parts before, not between here <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rapids <b>of</b> Sarn Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning, those are still many miles ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks <b>and</b> stony eyots in <b>the</b> stream. We must keep a sharp watch <b>and</b> not try <b>to</b> paddle swiftly.”
<br>   To Sam in <b>the</b> leading boat was given <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> watchman. He lay forward peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom. The night grew dark, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> stars above were strangely bright, <b>and</b> there was a glimmer On <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River. It was close <b>on</b> midnight, <b>and</b> they had been drifting for some while. hardly using <b>the</b> paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in <b>the</b> stream <b>and</b> he heard <b>the</b> swirl <b>of</b> racing water. There was a swift current which swung left, towards <b>the</b> eastern shore where <b>the</b> channel was clear. As they were swept aside <b>the</b> travellers could see, now very close, <b>the</b> pale foam <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream like a ridge <b>of</b> teeth. The boats were all huddled together.
<br>   “Hoy there, Aragorn! “shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> leader. “This is madness! We cannot dare <b>the</b> Rapids <b>by</b> night! But <b>no</b> boat can live in Sarn Gebir, be <b>it</b> night <b>or</b> day.”
<br>   “Back, back! “cried Aragorn. “Turn! Turn if you can! “He drove his paddle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, trying <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> boat <b>and</b> bring <b>it</b> round.
<br>   “I am out <b>of</b> my reckoning,” he said <b>to</b> Frodo. “I did not know that we had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought. Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already.”
<br>   With great efforts they checked <b>the</b> boats <b>and</b> slowly brought them about; <b>but</b> at first they could make only small headway against <b>the</b> current, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> time they were carried nearer <b>and</b> nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern bank. Now dark <b>and</b> ominous <b>it</b> loomed up in <b>the</b> night.
<br>   “All together, paddle! “shouted Boromir. “Paddle! Or we shall be driven <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoals.” Even as he spoke Frodo felt <b>the</b> keel beneath him grate upon stone.
<br>   At that moment there was a twang <b>of</b> bowstrings: several arrows whistled over them, <b>and</b> some fell among them. One smote Frodo between <b>the</b> shoulders <b>and</b> he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: <b>but</b> <b>the</b> arrow fell back. foiled <b>by</b> his hidden coat <b>of</b> mail. Another passed through Aragorn's hood; <b>and</b> a third stood fast in <b>the</b> gunwale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second boat, close <b>by</b> Merry's hand. Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro upon <b>the</b> long shingle-banks that lay under <b>the</b> eastern shore. They seemed very near.
<br>   “Yrch!” said Legolas, falling <b>into</b> his own tongue.
<br>   “Orcs! “cried Gimli.
<br>   “Gollum's doing, I'll be bound.” said Sam <b>to</b> Frodo. “And a nice place <b>to</b> choose, too. The River seems set <b>on</b> taking us right <b>into</b> their arms!”
<br>   They all leaned forward straining at <b>the</b> paddles: even Sam took a hand. Every moment they expected <b>to</b> feel <b>the</b> bite <b>of</b> black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead <b>or</b> struck <b>the</b> water nearby; <b>but</b> there were <b>no</b> more hits. It was dark, <b>but</b> not too dark for <b>the</b> night-eyes <b>of</b> Orcs, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless <b>it</b> was that <b>the</b> grey cloaks Of L?rien <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey timber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elf-wrought boats defeated <b>the</b> malice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archers <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   Stroke <b>by</b> stroke they laboured <b>on</b>. In <b>the</b> darkness <b>it</b> was hard <b>to</b> be sure that they were indeed moving at all; <b>but</b> slowly <b>the</b> swirl <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water grew less, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern bank faded back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night. At last, as far as they could judge, they had reached <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream again <b>and</b> had driven their boats back some distance above <b>the</b> jutting rocks. Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards <b>the</b> western shore. Under <b>the</b> shadow Of bushes leaning out over <b>the</b> water they halted <b>and</b> drew breath.
<br>   Legolas laid down his paddle <b>and</b> took up <b>the</b> bow that he had brought from L?rien. Then he sprang ashore <b>and</b> climbed a few paces up <b>the</b> bank. Stringing <b>the</b> bow <b>and</b> fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over <b>the</b> River <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. Across <b>the</b> water there were shrill cries, <b>but</b> nothing could be seen.
<br>   Frodo looked up at <b>the</b> Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night, seeking a mark <b>to</b> shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in <b>the</b> black pools <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky behind. But now rising <b>and</b> sailing up from <b>the</b> South <b>the</b> great clouds advanced, sending out dark outriders <b>into</b> <b>the</b> starry fields. A sudden dread fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “Elbereth Gilthoniel!” sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did so, a dark shape, like a cloud <b>and</b> yet not a cloud, for <b>it</b> moved far more swiftly, came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blackness in <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> sped towards <b>the</b> Company, blotting out all light as <b>it</b> approached. Soon <b>it</b> appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than <b>the</b> pits in <b>the</b> night. Fierce voices rose up <b>to</b> greet <b>it</b> from across <b>the</b> water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him <b>and</b> clutching at his heart; there was a deadly cold, like <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if <b>to</b> hide.
<br>   Suddenly <b>the</b> great bow <b>of</b> L?rien sang. Shrill went <b>the</b> arrow from <b>the</b> elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost above him <b>the</b> winged shape swerved. There was a harsh croaking scream, as <b>it</b> fell out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air, vanishing down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern shore. The sky was clean again. There was a tumult <b>of</b> many voices far away, cursing <b>and</b> wailing in <b>the</b> darkness, <b>and</b> then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from <b>the</b> east that night.
<br>   After a while Aragorn led <b>the</b> boats back upstream. They felt their way along <b>the</b> water's edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow bay. A few low trees grew there close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> behind them rose a steep rocky bank. Here <b>the</b> Company decided <b>to</b> stay <b>and</b> await <b>the</b> dawn: <b>it</b> was useless <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> move further <b>by</b> night. They made <b>no</b> camp <b>and</b> lit <b>no</b> fire, <b>but</b> lay huddled in <b>the</b> boats, moored close together.
<br>   “Praised be <b>the</b> bow <b>of</b> Galadriel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>and</b> eye <b>of</b> Legolas! “said Gimli, as he munched a wafer <b>of</b> lembas. “That was a mighty shot in <b>the</b> dark, my friend!”
<br>   “But who can say what <b>it</b> hit?” said Legolas.
<br>   “I cannot,” said Gimli. “But I am glad that <b>the</b> shadow came <b>no</b> nearer. I liked <b>it</b> not at all. Too much <b>it</b> reminded me <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow in Moria—<b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balrog,” he ended in a whisper.
<br>   “It was not a Balrog,” said Frodo, still shivering with <b>the</b> chill that had come upon him. “It was something colder. I think <b>it</b> was –” Then he paused <b>and</b> fell silent.
<br>   “What do you think? “asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he was trying <b>to</b> catch a glimpse <b>of</b> Frodo's face.
<br>   “I think—No, I will not say,” answered Frodo. “Whatever <b>it</b> was, its fall has dismayed our enemies.”
<br>   “So <b>it</b> seems,” said Aragorn. “Yet where they are, <b>and</b> how many, <b>and</b> what they will do next, we do not know. This night we must all be sleepless! Dark hides us now. But what <b>the</b> day will show who can tell? Have your weapons close <b>to</b> hand!”
<br>   Sam sat tapping <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his sword as if he were counting <b>on</b> his fingers, <b>and</b> looking up at <b>the</b> sky. “It's very strange,” he murmured. “The Moon's <b>the</b> same in <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> in Wilderland, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> ought <b>to</b> be. But either <b>it</b>'s out <b>of</b> its running, <b>or</b> I'm all wrong in my reckoning. You'll remember, Mr. Frodo, <b>the</b> Moon was waning as we lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flet up in that tree: a week from <b>the</b> full, I reckon. And we'd been a week <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way last night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never stayed <b>no</b> time in <b>the</b> Elvish country.
<br>   “Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, <b>and</b> I seem <b>to</b> remember several more, <b>but</b> I would take my oath <b>it</b> was never a whole month. Anyone would think that time did not count in there!”
<br>   “And perhaps that was <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>it</b>,” said Frodo. “In that land, maybe, we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone <b>by</b>. It was not, I think, until Silverlode bore us back <b>to</b> Anduin that we returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time that flows through mortal lands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Sea. And I don't remember any moon, either new <b>or</b> old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars <b>by</b> night <b>and</b> sun <b>by</b> day.”
<br>   Legolas stirred in his boat. “Nay, time does not tarry ever,” he said; “<b>but</b> change <b>and</b> growth is not in all things <b>and</b> places alike. For <b>the</b> Elves <b>the</b> world moves, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> moves both very swift <b>and</b> very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, <b>and</b> all else fleets <b>by</b>: <b>it</b> is a grief <b>to</b> them. Slow, because they do not count <b>the</b> running years, not for themselves. The passing seasons are <b>but</b> ripples ever repeated in <b>the</b> long long stream. Yet beneath <b>the</b> Sun all things must wear <b>to</b> an end at last.”
<br>   “But <b>the</b> wearing is slow in L?rien,” said Frodo. “The power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady is <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Rich are <b>the</b> hours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wields <b>the</b> Elven-ring.”
<br>   “That should not have been said outside L?rien, not even <b>to</b> me,” said Aragorn. “Speak <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>it</b>! But so <b>it</b> is, Sam: in that land you lost your count. There time flowed swiftly <b>by</b> us, as for <b>the</b> Elves. The old moon passed, <b>and</b> a new moon waxed <b>and</b> waned in <b>the</b> world outside, while we tarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter is nearly gone. Time flows <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a spring <b>of</b> little hope.”
<br>   The night passed silently. No voice <b>or</b> call was heard again across <b>the</b> water. The travellers huddled in their boats felt <b>the</b> changing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather. The air grew warm <b>and</b> very still under <b>the</b> great moist clouds that had floated up from <b>the</b> South <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distant seas. The rushing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River over <b>the</b> rocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapids seemed <b>to</b> grow louder <b>and</b> closer. The twigs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees above them began <b>to</b> drip.
<br>   When <b>the</b> day came <b>the</b> mood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world about them had become soft <b>and</b> sad. Slowly <b>the</b> dawn grew <b>to</b> a pale light, diffused <b>and</b> shadowless. There was mist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> white fog swathed <b>the</b> shore; <b>the</b> far bank could not be seen.
<br>   “I can't abide fog,” said Sam; “<b>but</b> this seems <b>to</b> be a lucky one. Now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.”
<br>   “Perhaps so,” said Aragorn. “But <b>it</b> will be hard <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> path unless <b>the</b> fog lifts a little later <b>on</b>. And we must find <b>the</b> path, if we are <b>to</b> pass Sarn Gebir <b>and</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil.”
<br>   “I do not see why we should pass <b>the</b> Rapids <b>or</b> follow <b>the</b> River any further,” said Boromir. “If <b>the</b> Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon these cockle-boats, <b>and</b> strike westward <b>and</b> southward, until we come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Entwash <b>and</b> cross <b>into</b> my own land.”
<br>   “We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,” said Aragorn, “<b>but</b> that is not yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous than <b>it</b> sounds. The vale <b>of</b> Entwash is flat <b>and</b> fenny, <b>and</b> fog is a deadly peril there for those <b>on</b> foot <b>and</b> laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The River is at least a path that cannot be missed.”
<br>   “But <b>the</b> Enemy holds <b>the</b> eastern bank,” objected Boromir. “And even if you pass <b>the</b> Gates <b>of</b> Argonath <b>and</b> come unmolested <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tindrock, what will you do then? Leap down <b>the</b> Falls <b>and</b> land in <b>the</b> marshes?”
<br>   “No! “answered Aragorn. “Say rather that we will bear our boats <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ancient way <b>to</b> Rauros-foot, <b>and</b> there take <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water again. Do you not know, Boromir, <b>or</b> do you choose <b>to</b> forget <b>the</b> North Stair, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> high seat upon Amon Hen, that were made in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great kings? I at least have a mind <b>to</b> stand in that high place again, before I decide my further course. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.”
<br>   Boromir held out long against this choice; <b>but</b> when <b>it</b> became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in. “It is not <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith <b>to</b> desert their friends at need,” he said, “<b>and</b> you will need my strength, if ever you are <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> Tindrock. To <b>the</b> tall isle I will go, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> further. There I shall turn <b>to</b> my home, alone if my help has not earned <b>the</b> reward <b>of</b> any companionship.”
<br>   The day was now growing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fog had lifted a little. It was decided that Aragorn <b>and</b> Legolas should at once go forward along <b>the</b> shore, while <b>the</b> others remained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> boats. Aragorn hoped <b>to</b> find some way <b>by</b> which they could carry both their boats <b>and</b> their baggage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smoother water beyond <b>the</b> Rapids.
<br>   “Boats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves would not sink, maybe,” he said, “<b>but</b> that does not say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive. None have ever done so yet. No road was made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Gondor in this region, for even in their great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond <b>the</b> Emyn Muil; <b>but</b> there is a portage-way somewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western shore, if I can find <b>it</b>. It cannot yet have perished; for light boats used <b>to</b> journey out <b>of</b> Wilderland down <b>to</b> Osgiliath, <b>and</b> still did so until a few years ago, when <b>the</b> Orcs <b>of</b> Mordor began <b>to</b> multiply.”
<br>   “Seldom in my life has any boat come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Orcs prowl <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east-shore,” said Boromir. “If you go forward, peril will grow with every mile, even if you find a path.”
<br>   “Peril lies ahead <b>on</b> every southward road,” answered Aragorn. “Wait for us one day. If we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader <b>and</b> follow him as best you can.”
<br>   It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn <b>and</b> Legolas climb <b>the</b> steep bank <b>and</b> vanish <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mists; <b>but</b> his fears proved groundless. Only two <b>or</b> three hours had passed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was barely mid-day, when <b>the</b> shadowy shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explorers appeared again.
<br>   “All is well,” said Aragorn, as he clambered down <b>the</b> bank. “There is a track, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> leads <b>to</b> a good landing that is still serviceable. The distance is not great: <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rapids is <b>but</b> half a mile below us, <b>and</b> they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them <b>the</b> stream becomes clear <b>and</b> smooth again, though <b>it</b> runs swiftly. Our hardest task will be <b>to</b> get our boats <b>and</b> baggage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old portage-way. We have found <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> lies well back from <b>the</b> water-side here, <b>and</b> runs under <b>the</b> lee <b>of</b> a rock-wall, a furlong <b>or</b> more from <b>the</b> shore. We did not find where <b>the</b> northward landing lies. If <b>it</b> still remains, we must have passed <b>it</b> yesterday night. We might labour far upstream <b>and</b> yet miss <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> fog. I fear we must leave <b>the</b> River now, <b>and</b> make for <b>the</b> portage-way as best we can from here.”
<br>   “That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,” said Boromir.
<br>   “Yet such as we are we will try <b>it</b>,” said Aragorn.
<br>   “Aye, we will,” said Gimli. “The legs <b>of</b> Men will lag <b>on</b> a rough road, while a Dwarf goes <b>on</b>, be <b>the</b> burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir!”
<br>   The task proved hard indeed, yet in <b>the</b> end <b>it</b> was done. The goods were taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boats <b>and</b> brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank, where there was a level space. Then <b>the</b> boats were drawn out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water <b>and</b> carried up. They were far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in <b>the</b> elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wood was tough <b>and</b> yet strangely light. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along <b>the</b> flat. Nonetheless <b>it</b> needed <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Men <b>to</b> lift <b>and</b> haul them over <b>the</b> ground that <b>the</b> Company now had <b>to</b> cross. It sloped up away from <b>the</b> River, a tumbled waste <b>of</b> grey limestone-boulders, with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds <b>and</b> bushes; there were thickets <b>of</b> brambles, <b>and</b> sheer dells; <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there boggy pools fed <b>by</b> waters trickling from <b>the</b> terraces further inland.
<br>   One <b>by</b> one Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn carried <b>the</b> boats, while <b>the</b> others toiled <b>and</b> scrambled after them with <b>the</b> baggage. At last all was removed <b>and</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from sprawling briars <b>and</b> many fallen stones, they moved forward all together. Fog still hung in veils upon <b>the</b> crumbling rock-wall, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their left mist shrouded <b>the</b> River: they could hear <b>it</b> rushing <b>and</b> foaming over <b>the</b> sharp shelves <b>and</b> stony teeth <b>of</b> Sarn Gebir, <b>but</b> they could not see <b>it</b>. Twice they made <b>the</b> journey, before all was brought safe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern landing.
<br>   There <b>the</b> portage-way, turning back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water-side, ran gently down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shallow edge <b>of</b> a little pool. It seemed <b>to</b> have been scooped in <b>the</b> river-side, not <b>by</b> hand, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> water swirling down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier <b>of</b> rock that jutted out some way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream. Beyond <b>it</b> <b>the</b> shore rose sheer <b>into</b> a grey cliff, <b>and</b> there was <b>no</b> further passage for those <b>on</b> foot.
<br>   Already <b>the</b> short afternoon was past, <b>and</b> a dim cloudy dusk was closing in. They sat beside <b>the</b> water listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confused rush <b>and</b> roar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rapids hidden in <b>the</b> mist; they were tired <b>and</b> sleepy, <b>and</b> their hearts were as gloomy as <b>the</b> dying day.
<br>   “Well, here we are, <b>and</b> here we must pass another night,” said Boromir. “We need sleep, <b>and</b> even if Aragorn had a mind <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> Gates <b>of</b> Argonath <b>by</b> night, we are all too tired-except, <b>no</b> doubt, our sturdy dwarf.”
<br>   Gimli made <b>no</b> reply: he was nodding as he sat.
<br>   “Let us rest as much as we can now,” said Aragorn. “Tomorrow we must journey <b>by</b> day again. Unless <b>the</b> weather changes once more <b>and</b> cheats us, we shall have a good chance <b>of</b> slipping through, unseen <b>by</b> any eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off <b>and</b> one <b>on</b> guard.”
<br>   Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle <b>of</b> rain an hour before dawn. As soon as <b>it</b> was fully light they started. Already <b>the</b> fog was thinning. They kept as close as they could <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western side, <b>and</b> they could see <b>the</b> dim shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls with their feet in <b>the</b> hurrying river. In <b>the</b> mid-morning <b>the</b> clouds drew down lower, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> rain heavily. They drew <b>the</b> skin-covers over their boats <b>to</b> prevent them from being flooded, <b>and</b> drifted <b>on</b>: little could be seen before them <b>or</b> about them through <b>the</b> grey falling curtains.
<br>   The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly <b>the</b> sky above grew lighter, <b>and</b> then suddenly <b>the</b> clouds broke, <b>and</b> their draggled fringes trailed away northward up <b>the</b> River. The fogs <b>and</b> mists were gone. Before <b>the</b> travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides <b>to</b> which clung, upon shelves <b>and</b> in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River swifter. Now they were speeding along with little hope <b>of</b> stopping <b>or</b> turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a lane <b>of</b> pale-blue sky, around them <b>the</b> dark overshadowed River, <b>and</b> before them black, shutting out <b>the</b> sun, <b>the</b> hills <b>of</b> Emyn Muil, in which <b>no</b> opening could be seen.
<br>   Frodo peering forward saw in <b>the</b> distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles <b>or</b> pillars <b>of</b> stone they seemed. Tall <b>and</b> sheer <b>and</b> ominous they stood upon either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream. A narrow gap appeared between them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River swept <b>the</b> boats towards <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Behold <b>the</b> Argonath, <b>the</b> Pillars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings! “cried Aragorn. “We shall pass them soon. Keep <b>the</b> boats in line, <b>and</b> as far apart as you can! Hold <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream!”
<br>   As Frodo was borne towards them <b>the</b> great pillars rose like towers <b>to</b> meet him. Giants they seemed <b>to</b> him, vast grey figures silent <b>but</b> threatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped <b>and</b> fashioned: <b>the</b> craft <b>and</b> power <b>of</b> old had wrought upon them, <b>and</b> still they preserved through <b>the</b> suns <b>and</b> rains <b>of</b> forgotten years <b>the</b> mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in <b>the</b> deep waters stood two great kings <b>of</b> stone: still with blurred eyes <b>and</b> crannied brows they frowned upon <b>the</b> North. The left hand <b>of</b> each was raised palm outwards in gesture <b>of</b> warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head there was a crumbling helm <b>and</b> crown. Great power <b>and</b> majesty they still wore, <b>the</b> silent wardens <b>of</b> a long-vanished kingdom. Awe <b>and</b> fear fell upon Frodo, <b>and</b> he cowered down, shutting his eyes <b>and</b> not daring <b>to</b> look up as <b>the</b> boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as <b>the</b> boats whirled <b>by</b>. frail <b>and</b> fleeting as little leaves, under <b>the</b> enduring shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentinels <b>of</b> N?menor. So they passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark chasm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates.
<br>   Sheer rose <b>the</b> dreadful cliffs <b>to</b> unguessed heights <b>on</b> either side. Far off was <b>the</b> dim sky. The black waters roared <b>and</b> echoed, <b>and</b> a wind screamed over them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering <b>and</b> groaning: “What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get out <b>of</b> this boat, <b>and</b> I'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river!”
<br>   “Fear not! “said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned <b>and</b> saw Strider, <b>and</b> yet not Strider; for <b>the</b> weatherworn Ranger was <b>no</b> longer there. In <b>the</b> stern sat Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn, proud <b>and</b> erect, guiding <b>the</b> boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, <b>and</b> his dark hair was blowing in <b>the</b> wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile <b>to</b> his own land.
<br>   “Fear not! “he said. “Long have I desired <b>to</b> look upon <b>the</b> likenesses <b>of</b> Isildur <b>and</b> An?rion, my sires <b>of</b> old. Under their shadow Elessar, <b>the</b> Elfstone son <b>of</b> Arathorn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Valandil Isildur's son heir <b>of</b> Elendil, has nought <b>to</b> dread!”
<br>   Then <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> his eyes faded, <b>and</b> he spoke <b>to</b> himself: “Would that Gandalf were here! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> my own city! But whither now shall I go?”
<br>   The chasm was long <b>and</b> dark, <b>and</b> filled with <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> wind <b>and</b> rushing water <b>and</b> echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards <b>the</b> west so that at first all was dark ahead; <b>but</b> soon Frodo saw a tall gap <b>of</b> light before him, ever growing. Swiftly <b>it</b> drew near, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>the</b> boats shot through, out <b>into</b> a wide clear light.
<br>   The sun, already long fallen from <b>the</b> noon, was shining in a windy sky. The pent waters spread out <b>into</b> a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced <b>by</b> steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, <b>but</b> their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in <b>the</b> sunlight. At <b>the</b> far southern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from <b>the</b> others <b>and</b> sundered from them, an island in <b>the</b> waters, about which <b>the</b> flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant <b>but</b> deep there came up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wind a roaring sound like <b>the</b> roll <b>of</b> thunder heard far away.
<br>   “Behold Tol Brandir! “said Aragorn, pointing south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tall peak. “Upon <b>the</b> left stands Amon Lhaw, <b>and</b> upon <b>the</b> right is Amon Hen <b>the</b> Hills <b>of</b> Hearing <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Sight. In <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great kings there were high seats upon them, <b>and</b> watch was kept there. But <b>it</b> is said that <b>no</b> foot <b>of</b> man <b>or</b> beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere <b>the</b> shade <b>of</b> night falls we shall come <b>to</b> them. I hear <b>the</b> endless voice <b>of</b> Rauros calling.”
<br>   The Company rested now for a while, drifting south <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current that flowed through <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. They ate some food, <b>and</b> then they took <b>to</b> their paddles <b>and</b> hastened <b>on</b> their way. The sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> westward hills fell <b>into</b> shadow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun grew round <b>and</b> red. Here <b>and</b> there a misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in <b>the</b> twilight. Rauros was roaring with a great voice. Already night was laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flowing waters when <b>the</b> travellers came at last under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills.
<br>   The tenth day <b>of</b> their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them. They could go <b>no</b> further without choice between <b>the</b> east-way <b>and</b> <b>the</b> west. The last stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quest was before them.
<br>   
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP
<br>   
<br>   Aragorn led them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River. Here upon its western side under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water from <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> Amon Hen. Behind <b>it</b> rose <b>the</b> first gentle slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill clad with trees, <b>and</b> trees marched away westward along <b>the</b> curving shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. A little spring fell tumbling down <b>and</b> fed <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   “Here we will rest tonight,” said Aragorn. “This is <b>the</b> lawn <b>of</b> Parth Galen: a fair place in <b>the</b> summer days <b>of</b> old. Let us hope that <b>no</b> evil has yet come here.”
<br>   They drew up their boats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green banks, <b>and</b> beside them they made their camp. They set a watch, <b>but</b> had <b>no</b> sight nor sound <b>of</b> their enemies. If Gollum had contrived <b>to</b> follow them, he remained unseen <b>and</b> unheard. Nonetheless as <b>the</b> night wore <b>on</b> Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in his sleep <b>and</b> waking. In <b>the</b> small hours he got up <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> Frodo, whose turn <b>it</b> was <b>to</b> watch.
<br>   “Why are you waking? “asked Frodo. “It is not your watch.”
<br>   “I do not know,” answered Aragorn; “<b>but</b> a shadow <b>and</b> a threat has been growing in my sleep. It would be well <b>to</b> draw your sword.”
<br>   “Why? “said Frodo. “Are enemies at hand?”
<br>   “Let us see what Sting may show,” answered Aragorn.
<br>   Frodo then drew <b>the</b> elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay <b>the</b> edges gleamed dimly in <b>the</b> night. “Orcs! “he said. “Not very near, <b>and</b> yet too near, <b>it</b> seems.”
<br>   “I feared as much,” said Aragorn. “But maybe they are not <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River. The light <b>of</b> Sting is faint, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may point <b>to</b> <b>no</b> more than spies <b>of</b> Mordor roaming <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> Amon Lhaw. I have never heard before <b>of</b> Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in these evil days, now that Minas Tirith <b>no</b> longer holds secure <b>the</b> passages <b>of</b> Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow.”
<br>   The day came like fire <b>and</b> smoke. Low in <b>the</b> East there were black bars <b>of</b> cloud like <b>the</b> fumes <b>of</b> a great burning. The rising sun lit them from beneath with flames <b>of</b> murky red; <b>but</b> soon <b>it</b> climbed above them <b>into</b> a clear sky. The summit <b>of</b> Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo looked out eastward <b>and</b> gazed at <b>the</b> tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> running water. High up above <b>the</b> tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed, mounting one head above another; <b>and</b> above them again were grey faces <b>of</b> inaccessible rock, crowned <b>by</b> a great spire <b>of</b> stone. Many birds were circling about <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> other living things could be seen.
<br>   When they had eaten, Aragorn called <b>the</b> Company together. “The day has come at last,” he said: “<b>the</b> day <b>of</b> choice which we have long delayed. What shall now become <b>of</b> our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship? Shall we turn west with Boromir <b>and</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wars <b>of</b> Gondor; <b>or</b> turn east <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fear <b>and</b> Shadow; <b>or</b> shall we break our fellowship <b>and</b> go this way <b>and</b> that as each may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern shore, we know; <b>but</b> I fear that <b>the</b> Orcs may already be <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water.”
<br>   There was a long silence in which <b>no</b> one spoke <b>or</b> moved.
<br>   “Well, Frodo,” said Aragorn at last. “I fear that <b>the</b> burden is laid upon you. You are <b>the</b> Bearer appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Council. Your own way you alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, <b>and</b> though I have tried <b>to</b> bear his part, I do not know what design <b>or</b> hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely <b>it</b> seems that if he were here now <b>the</b> choice would still wait <b>on</b> you. Such is your fate.”
<br>   Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. “I know that haste is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me an hour longer, <b>and</b> I will speak. Let me be alone!”
<br>   Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. “Very well, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo,” he said. “You shall have an hour, <b>and</b> you shall be alone. We will stay here for a while. But do not stray far <b>or</b> out <b>of</b> call.”
<br>   Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching his master with great concern, shook his head <b>and</b> muttered: “Plain as a pikestaff <b>it</b> is, <b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.” ,
<br>   Presently Frodo got up <b>and</b> walked away; <b>and</b> Sam saw that while <b>the</b> others restrained themselves <b>and</b> did not stare at him, <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> Boromir followed Frodo intently, until he passed out <b>of</b> sight in <b>the</b> trees at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> Amon Hen.
<br>   Wandering aimlessly at first in <b>the</b> wood, Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. He came <b>to</b> a path, <b>the</b> dwindling ruins <b>of</b> a road <b>of</b> long ago. In steep places stairs <b>of</b> stone had been hewn, <b>but</b> now they were cracked <b>and</b> worn, <b>and</b> split <b>by</b> <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> trees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he came <b>to</b> a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> midst was a wide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> was filled now with <b>the</b> early sunlight. Frodo halted <b>and</b> looked out over <b>the</b> River, far below him, <b>to</b> Tol Brandir <b>and</b> <b>the</b> birds wheeling in <b>the</b> great gulf <b>of</b> air between him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> untrodden isle. The voice <b>of</b> Rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom.
<br>   He sat down upon <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> cupped his chin in his hands, staring eastwards <b>but</b> seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo left <b>the</b> Shire was passing through his mind, <b>and</b> he recalled <b>and</b> pondered everything that he could remember <b>of</b> Gandalf's words. Time went <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> still he was <b>no</b> nearer <b>to</b> a choice.
<br>   Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came <b>to</b> him that something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. He sprang up <b>and</b> turned; <b>but</b> all that he saw <b>to</b> his surprise was Boromir, <b>and</b> his face was smiling <b>and</b> kind.
<br>   “I was afraid for you, Frodo,” he said, coming forward. “If Aragorn is right <b>and</b> Orcs are near, then none <b>of</b> us should wander alone, <b>and</b> you least <b>of</b> all: so much depends <b>on</b> you. And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now <b>and</b> talk for a while, since I have found you? It would comfort me. Where there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together may perhaps find wisdom.”
<br>   “You are kind,” answered Frodo. “But I do not think that any speech will help me. For I know what I should do, <b>but</b> I am afraid <b>of</b> doing <b>it</b>, Boromir: afraid.”
<br>   Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly <b>on</b>. The wind murmured in <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. Frodo shivered.
<br>   Suddenly Boromir came <b>and</b> sat beside him. “Are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly? “he said. “I wish <b>to</b> help you. You need counsel in your hard choice. Will you not take mine?”
<br>   “I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,” said Frodo. “And <b>it</b> would seem like wisdom <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> warning <b>of</b> my heart.”
<br>   “Warning? Warning against what? “said Boromir sharply.
<br>   “Against delay. Against <b>the</b> way that seems easier. Against refusal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burden that is laid <b>on</b> me. Against-well, if <b>it</b> must be said, against trust in <b>the</b> strength <b>and</b> truth <b>of</b> Men.”
<br>   “Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country, though you knew <b>it</b> not.”
<br>   “I do not doubt <b>the</b> valour <b>of</b> your people. But <b>the</b> world is changing. The walls <b>of</b> Minas Tirith may be strong, <b>but</b> they are not strong enough. If they fail, what then?”
<br>   “We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they will not fail.”
<br>   “No hope while <b>the</b> Ring lasts,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Ah! The Ring! “said Boromir, his eyes lighting. “The Ring! Is <b>it</b> not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear <b>and</b> doubt for so small a thing? So small a thing! And I have seen <b>it</b> only for an instant in <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elrond. Could I not have a sight <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again?”
<br>   Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught <b>the</b> strange gleam in Boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind <b>and</b> friendly. “It is best that <b>it</b> should lie hidden,” he answered.
<br>   “As you wish. I care not,” said Boromir. “Yet may I not even speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>? For you seem ever <b>to</b> think only <b>of</b> its power in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy: <b>of</b> its evil uses not <b>of</b> its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas Tirith will fall, if <b>the</b> Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if <b>the</b> Ring were with <b>the</b> Enemy. But why, if <b>it</b> were with us?”
<br>   “Were you not at <b>the</b> Council? “answered Frodo. “Because we cannot use <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> what is done with <b>it</b> turns <b>to</b> evil.”
<br>   Boromir got up <b>and</b> walked about impatiently. “So you go <b>on</b>,” he cried. “Gandalf, Elrond—all these folk have taught you <b>to</b> say so. For themselves they may be right. These elves <b>and</b> half-elves <b>and</b> wizards, they would come <b>to</b> grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise <b>and</b> not merely timid. But each <b>to</b> his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We <b>of</b> Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years <b>of</b> trial. We do not desire <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> wizard-lords, only strength <b>to</b> defend ourselves, strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings <b>to</b> light <b>the</b> -Ring <b>of</b> Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foes <b>of</b> Mordor. It is mad not <b>to</b> use <b>it</b>, <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy against him. The fearless, <b>the</b> ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior do in this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why not Boromir? The Ring would give me power <b>of</b> Command. How I would drive <b>the</b> hosts <b>of</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> all men would flock <b>to</b> my banner!”
<br>   Boromir strode up <b>and</b> down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed <b>to</b> have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt <b>on</b> walls <b>and</b> weapons, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mustering <b>of</b> men; <b>and</b> he drew plans for great alliances <b>and</b> glorious victories <b>to</b> be; <b>and</b> he cast down Mordor, <b>and</b> became himself a mighty king, benevolent <b>and</b> wise. Suddenly he stopped <b>and</b> waved his arms.
<br>   “And they tell us <b>to</b> throw <b>it</b> away!” he cried. “I do not say destroy <b>it</b>. That might be well, if reason could show any hope <b>of</b> doing so. It does not. The only plan that is proposed <b>to</b> us is that a halfling should walk blindly <b>into</b> Mordor <b>and</b> offer <b>the</b> Enemy every chance <b>of</b> recapturing <b>it</b> for himself. Folly!
<br>   “Surely you see <b>it</b>, my friend?” he said, turning now suddenly <b>to</b> Frodo again. “You say that you are afraid. If <b>it</b> is so, <b>the</b> boldest should pardon you. But is <b>it</b> not really your good sense that revolts?”
<br>   “No, I am afraid,” said Frodo. “Simply afraid. But I am glad <b>to</b> have heard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.”
<br>   “Then you will come <b>to</b> Minas Tirith? “cried Boromir. His eyes were shining <b>and</b> his face eager.
<br>   “You misunderstand me,” said Frodo.
<br>   “But you will come, at least for a while? “Boromir persisted. “My city is not far now; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is little further from there <b>to</b> Mordor than from here. We have been long in <b>the</b> wilderness, <b>and</b> you need news <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,” he said. “You need rest before your venture. if go you must.” He laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hobbit's shoulder in friendly fashion; <b>but</b> Frodo felt <b>the</b> hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, <b>and</b> eyed with alarm <b>the</b> tall Man, nearly twice his height <b>and</b> many times his match in strength.
<br>   “Why are you so unfriendly? “said Boromir. “I am a true man, neither thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; <b>but</b> I give you my word that I do not desire <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b>. Will you not at least let me make trial <b>of</b> my plan? Lend me <b>the</b> Ring!”
<br>   “No! <b>no</b>! “cried Frodo. “The Council laid <b>it</b> upon me <b>to</b> bear <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “It is <b>by</b> our own folly that <b>the</b> Enemy will defeat us,” cried Boromir. “How <b>it</b> angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully <b>to</b> death <b>and</b> ruining our cause. If any mortals have claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ring, <b>it</b> is <b>the</b> men <b>of</b> N?menor, <b>and</b> not Halflings. It is not yours save <b>by</b> unhappy chance. It might have been mine. It should be mine. Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me!”
<br>   Frodo did not answer, <b>but</b> moved away till <b>the</b> great flat stone stood between them. “Come, come, my friend! “said Boromir in a softer voice. “Why not get rid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>? Why not be free <b>of</b> your doubt <b>and</b> fear? You can lay <b>the</b> blame <b>on</b> me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> <b>by</b> force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,” he cried; <b>and</b> suddenly he sprang over <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> leaped at Frodo. His fair <b>and</b> pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes.
<br>   Frodo dodged aside <b>and</b> again put <b>the</b> stone between them. There was only one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out <b>the</b> Ring upon its chain <b>and</b> quickly slipped <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, <b>and</b> then ran wildly about, seeking here <b>and</b> there among <b>the</b> rocks <b>and</b> trees.
<br>   “Miserable trickster!” he shouted. “Let me get my hands <b>on</b> you! Now I see your mind. You will take <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> Sauron <b>and</b> sell us all. You have only waited your chance <b>to</b> leave us in <b>the</b> lurch. Curse you <b>and</b> all halflings <b>to</b> death <b>and</b> darkness! “Then, catching his foot <b>on</b> a stone, he fell sprawling <b>and</b> lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept.
<br>   He rose <b>and</b> passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away <b>the</b> tears. “What have I said? “he cried. “What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! “he called. “Come back! A madness took me, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> has passed. Come back!”
<br>   There was <b>no</b> answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already far away, leaping blindly up <b>the</b> path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill-top. Terror <b>and</b> grief shook him, seeing in his thought <b>the</b> mad fierce face <b>of</b> Boromir, <b>and</b> his burning eyes.
<br>   Soon he came out alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit <b>of</b> Amon Hen, <b>and</b> halted, gasping for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty flags, <b>and</b> surrounded with a crumbling battlement; <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> middle, set upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached <b>by</b> a stair <b>of</b> many steps. Up he went <b>and</b> sat upon <b>the</b> ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon <b>the</b> throne <b>of</b> mountain-kings.
<br>   At first he could see little. He seemed <b>to</b> be in a world <b>of</b> mist in which there were only shadows: <b>the</b> Ring was upon him. Then here <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> mist gave way <b>and</b> he saw many visions: small <b>and</b> clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, <b>and</b> yet remote. There was <b>no</b> sound, only bright living images. The world seemed <b>to</b> have shrunk <b>and</b> fallen silent. He was sitting upon <b>the</b> Seat <b>of</b> Seeing, <b>on</b> Amon Hen, <b>the</b> Hill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> N?menor. Eastward he looked <b>into</b> wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, <b>and</b> forests unexplored. Northward he looked, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains stood small <b>and</b> hard as broken teeth. Westward he looked <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> broad pastures <b>of</b> Rohan; <b>and</b> Orthanc, <b>the</b> pinnacle <b>of</b> Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, <b>and</b> below his very feet <b>the</b> Great River curled like a toppling wave <b>and</b> plunged over <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Rauros <b>into</b> a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon <b>the</b> fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, <b>the</b> mighty delta <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> myriads <b>of</b> sea-birds whirling like a white dust in <b>the</b> sun, <b>and</b> beneath them a green <b>and</b> silver sea, rippling in endless lines.
<br>   But everywhere he looked he saw <b>the</b> signs <b>of</b> war. The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills: orcs were issuing out <b>of</b> a thousand holes. Under <b>the</b> boughs <b>of</b> Mirkwood there was deadly strife <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men <b>and</b> fell beasts. The land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; smoke rose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> L?rien.
<br>   Horsemen were galloping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass <b>of</b> Rohan; wolves poured from Isengard. From <b>the</b> havens <b>of</b> Harad ships <b>of</b> war put out <b>to</b> sea; <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots <b>of</b> chieftains <b>and</b> laden wains. All <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord was in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away <b>it</b> seemed. <b>and</b> beautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud <b>and</b> fair upon its mountain-seat; its battlements glittered with steel, <b>and</b> its turrets were bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith was set another fortress, greater <b>and</b> more strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed <b>the</b> ruined bridges <b>of</b> Osgiliath, <b>the</b> grinning gates <b>of</b> Minas Morgul. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> haunted Mountains, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> looked upon Gorgoroth, <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> terror in <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor. Darkness lay there under <b>the</b> Sun. Fire glowed amid <b>the</b> smoke. Mount Doom was burning, <b>and</b> a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain <b>of</b> iron, gate <b>of</b> steel, tower <b>of</b> adamant, he saw <b>it</b>: Barad-d?r, Fortress <b>of</b> Sauron. All hope left him.
<br>   And suddenly he felt <b>the</b> Eye. There was an eye in <b>the</b> Dark Tower that did not sleep. He knew that <b>it</b> had become aware <b>of</b> his gaze. A fierce eager will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt <b>it</b>, searching for him. Very soon <b>it</b> would nail him down, know just exactly where he was. Amon Lhaw <b>it</b> touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself from <b>the</b> seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.
<br>   He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was <b>it</b>: Verily I come, I come <b>to</b> you? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point <b>of</b> power there came <b>to</b> his mind another thought: Take <b>it</b> off! Take <b>it</b> off! Fool, take <b>it</b> off! Take off <b>the</b> Ring!
<br>   The two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he was aware <b>of</b> himself again. Frodo, neither <b>the</b> Voice nor <b>the</b> Eye: free <b>to</b> choose, <b>and</b> with one remaining instant in which <b>to</b> do so. He took <b>the</b> Ring off his finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before <b>the</b> high seat. A black shadow seemed <b>to</b> pass like an arm above him; <b>it</b> missed Amon Hen <b>and</b> groped out west, <b>and</b> faded. Then all <b>the</b> sky was clean <b>and</b> blue <b>and</b> birds sang in every tree.
<br>   Frodo rose <b>to</b> his feet. A great weariness was <b>on</b> him, <b>but</b> his will was firm <b>and</b> his heart lighter. He spoke aloud <b>to</b> himself. “I will do now what I must,” he said. “This at least is plain: <b>the</b> evil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring is already at work even in <b>the</b> Company, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring must leave them before <b>it</b> does more harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, <b>and</b> those I can trust are too dear <b>to</b> me: poor old Sam, <b>and</b> Merry <b>and</b> Pippin. Strider, too: his heart yearns for Minas Tirith, <b>and</b> he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen <b>into</b> evil. I will go alone. At once.”
<br>   He went quickly down <b>the</b> path <b>and</b> came back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawn where Boromir had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries <b>and</b> calls from <b>the</b> woods near <b>the</b> shore below.
<br>   “They'll be hunting for me,” he said. “I wonder how long I have been away. Hours, I should think.” He hesitated. “What can I do? “he muttered. “I must go now <b>or</b> I shall never go. I shan't get a chance again. I hate leaving them, <b>and</b> like this without any explanation. But surely they will understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?”
<br>   Slowly he drew out <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> once more. He vanished <b>and</b> passed down <b>the</b> hill, less than a rustle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind.
<br>   The others remained long <b>by</b> <b>the</b> river-side. For some time they had been silent, moving restlessly about; <b>but</b> now they were sitting in a circle, <b>and</b> they were talking. Every now <b>and</b> again they made efforts <b>to</b> speak <b>of</b> other things, <b>of</b> their long road <b>and</b> many adventures; they questioned Aragorn concerning <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> Gondor <b>and</b> its ancient history, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> remnants <b>of</b> its great works that could still be seen in this strange border-land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil: <b>the</b> stone kings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seats <b>of</b> Lhaw <b>and</b> Hen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> great Stair beside <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Rauros. But always their thoughts <b>and</b> words strayed back <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring. What would Frodo choose <b>to</b> do? Why was he hesitating?
<br>   “He is debating which course is <b>the</b> most desperate, I think,” said Aragorn. “And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> go east, since we have been tracked <b>by</b> Gollum, <b>and</b> must fear that <b>the</b> secret <b>of</b> our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is <b>no</b> nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burden.
<br>   “We may remain there for a while <b>and</b> make a brave stand; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Lord Denethor <b>and</b> all his men cannot hope <b>to</b> do what even Elrond said was beyond his power: either <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> Burden secret. <b>or</b> <b>to</b> hold off <b>the</b> full might <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy when he comes <b>to</b> take <b>it</b>. Which way would any <b>of</b> us choose in Frodo's place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.”
<br>   “Grievous is our loss,” said Legolas. “Yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, <b>and</b> so help Frodo? Let us call him back <b>and</b> then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.”
<br>   “And so should I,” said Gimli. “We, <b>of</b> course, were only sent <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> Bearer along <b>the</b> road, <b>to</b> go <b>no</b> further than we wished; <b>and</b> none <b>of</b> us is under any oath <b>or</b> command <b>to</b> seek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting from Lothl?rien. Yet I have come so far, <b>and</b> I say this: now we have reached <b>the</b> last choice, <b>it</b> is clear <b>to</b> me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose Minas Tirith, <b>but</b> if he does not, then I follow him.”
<br>   “And I too will go with him,” said Legolas. “It would be faithless now <b>to</b> say farewell.”
<br>   “It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,” said Aragorn. “But if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three <b>or</b> two, <b>or</b> one alone. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three companions: Sam, who could not bear <b>it</b> otherwise; <b>and</b> Gimli; <b>and</b> myself. Boromir will return <b>to</b> his own city, where his father <b>and</b> his people need him; <b>and</b> with him <b>the</b> others should go, <b>or</b> at least Meriadoc <b>and</b> Peregrin, if Legolas is not willing <b>to</b> leave us.”
<br>   “That won't do at all! “cried Merry. “We can't leave Frodo! Pippin <b>and</b> I always intended <b>to</b> go wherever he went, <b>and</b> we still do. But we did not realize what that would mean. It seemed different so far away, in <b>the</b> Shire <b>or</b> in Rivendell. It would be mad <b>and</b> cruel <b>to</b> let Frodo go <b>to</b> Mordor. Why can't we stop him?”
<br>   “We must stop him,” said Pippin. “And that is what he is worrying about, I am sure. He knows we shan't agree <b>to</b> his going east. And he doesn't like <b>to</b> ask anyone <b>to</b> go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine <b>it</b>: going off <b>to</b> Mordor alone! “Pippin shuddered. “But <b>the</b> dear silly old hobbit, he ought <b>to</b> know that he hasn't got <b>to</b> ask. He ought <b>to</b> know that if we can't stop him, we shan't leave him.”
<br>   “Begging your pardon,” said Sam. “I don't think you understand my master at all. He isn't hesitating about which way <b>to</b> go. Of course not! What's <b>the</b> good <b>of</b> Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your pardon, Master Boromir,” he added, <b>and</b> turned. It was then that they discovered that Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle, was <b>no</b> longer there.
<br>   “Now where's he got <b>to</b>? “cried Sam, looking worried. “He's been a bit queer lately, <b>to</b> my mind. But anyway he's not in this business. He's off <b>to</b> his home, as he always said; <b>and</b> <b>no</b> blame <b>to</b> him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows he's got <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Cracks <b>of</b> Doom, if he can. But he's afraid. Now <b>it</b>'s come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point, he's just plain terrified. That's what his trouble is. Of course he's had a bit <b>of</b> schooling, so <b>to</b> speak-we all have-since we left home, <b>or</b> he'd be so terrified he'd just fling <b>the</b> Ring in <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> bolt. But he's still too frightened <b>to</b> start. And he isn't worrying about us either: whether we'll go along with him <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. He knows we mean <b>to</b>. That's another thing that's bothering him. If he screws himself up <b>to</b> go, he'll want <b>to</b> go alone. Mark my words! We're going <b>to</b> have trouble when he comes back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins.”
<br>   “I believe you speak more wisely than any <b>of</b> us, Sam,” said Aragorn. “And what shall we do, if you prove right?”
<br>   “Stop him! Don't let him go! “cried Pippin.
<br>   “I wonder? “said Aragorn. “He is <b>the</b> Bearer, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burden is <b>on</b> him. I do not think that <b>it</b> is our part <b>to</b> drive him one way <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are other powers at work far stronger.”
<br>   “Well, I wish Frodo would “screw himself up” <b>and</b> come back. <b>and</b> let us get <b>it</b> over,” said Pippin. “This waiting is horrible! Surely <b>the</b> time is up?”
<br>   “Yes,” said Aragorn. “The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing away. We must call for him.”
<br>   At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> walked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim <b>and</b> sad. He paused as if counting those that were present, <b>and</b> then sat down aloof, with his eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.
<br>   “Where have you been, Boromir? “asked Aragorn. “Have you seen Frodo?”
<br>   Boromir hesitated for a second. “Yes, <b>and</b> <b>no</b>,” he answered slowly. “Yes: I found him some way up <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> I spoke <b>to</b> him. I urged him <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> Minas Tirith <b>and</b> not <b>to</b> go east. I grew angry <b>and</b> he left me. He vanished. I have never seen such a thing happen before. though I have heard <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in tales. He must have put <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b>. I could not find him again. I thought he would return <b>to</b> you.”
<br>   “Is that all that you have <b>to</b> say? “said Aragorn, looking hard <b>and</b> not too kindly at Boromir.
<br>   “Yes,” he answered. “I will say <b>no</b> more yet.”
<br>   “This is bad!” cried Sam, jumping up. “I don't know what this Man has been up <b>to</b>. Why should Mr. Frodo put <b>the</b> thing <b>on</b>? He didn't ought <b>to</b> have; <b>and</b> if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!”
<br>   “But he wouldn't keep <b>it</b> <b>on</b>`” said Merry. “Not when he had escaped <b>the</b> unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “But where did he go? Where is he? “cried Pippin. “He's been away ages now.”
<br>   “How long is <b>it</b> since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? “asked Aragorn.
<br>   “Half an hour, maybe,” he answered. “Or <b>it</b> might be an hour. I have wandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know! “He put his head in his hands, <b>and</b> sat as if bowed with grief.
<br>   “An hour since he vanished! “shouted Sam. “We must try <b>and</b> find him at once. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>   “Wait a moment! “cried Aragorn. “We must divide up <b>into</b> pairs, <b>and</b> arrange-here, hold <b>on</b>! Wait!”
<br>   It was <b>no</b> good. They took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> him. Sam had dashed off first. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin had followed, <b>and</b> were already disappearing westward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo! in their clear, high hobbit-voices. Legolas <b>and</b> Gimli were running. A sudden panic <b>or</b> madness seemed <b>to</b> have fallen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “We shall all be scattered <b>and</b> lost,” groaned Aragorn. “Boromir! I do not know what part you have played in this mischief, <b>but</b> help now! Go after those two young hobbits, <b>and</b> guard them at <b>the</b> least, even if you cannot find Frodo. Come back <b>to</b> this spot, if you find him, <b>or</b> any traces <b>of</b> him. I shall return soon.”
<br>   Aragorn sprang swiftly away <b>and</b> went in pursuit <b>of</b> Sam. Just as he reached <b>the</b> little lawn among <b>the</b> rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill, panting <b>and</b> calling, Frodo!
<br>   “Come with me, Sam! “he said. “None <b>of</b> us should be alone. There is mischief about. I feel <b>it</b>. I am going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Seat <b>of</b> Amon Hen, <b>to</b> see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went this way. Follow me, <b>and</b> keep your eyes open! “He sped up <b>the</b> path.
<br>   Sam did his best, <b>but</b> he could not keep up with Strider <b>the</b> Ranger, <b>and</b> soon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn was out <b>of</b> sight ahead. Sam stopped <b>and</b> puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand <b>to</b> his head.
<br>   “Whoa, Sam Gamgee! “he said aloud. “Your legs are too short, so use your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; <b>but</b> he hasn't told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed himself up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point, sudden. He made up his mind at last <b>to</b> go. Where <b>to</b>? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel hard.”
<br>   Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away <b>the</b> tears. “Steady, Gamgee! “he said. “Think, if you can! He can't fly across rivers, <b>and</b> he can't jump waterfalls. He's got <b>no</b> gear. So he's got <b>to</b> get back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boats. Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boats! Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boats, Sam, like lightning!”
<br>   Sam turned <b>and</b> bolted back down <b>the</b> path. He fell <b>and</b> cut his knees. Up he got <b>and</b> ran <b>on</b>. He came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawn <b>of</b> Parth Galen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shore, where <b>the</b> boats were drawn up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. No one was there. There seemed <b>to</b> be cries in <b>the</b> woods behind, <b>but</b> he did not heed them. He stood gazing for a moment. stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down <b>the</b> bank all <b>by</b> itself. With a shout Sam raced across <b>the</b> grass. The boat slipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water.
<br>   “Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! “called Sam, <b>and</b> flung himself from <b>the</b> bank, clutching at <b>the</b> departing boat. He missed <b>it</b> <b>by</b> a yard. With a cry <b>and</b> a splash he fell face downward <b>into</b> deep swift water. Gurgling he went under, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River closed over his curly head.
<br>   An exclamation <b>of</b> dismay came from <b>the</b> empty boat. A paddle swirled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> boat put about. Frodo was just in time <b>to</b> grasp Sam <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hair as he came up, bubbling <b>and</b> struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes.
<br>   “Up you come, Sam my lad! “said Frodo. “Now take my hand!”
<br>   “Save me, Mr. Frodo! “gasped Sam. “I'm drownded. I can't see your hand.”
<br>   “Here <b>it</b> is. Don't pinch, lad! I won't let you go. Tread water <b>and</b> don't flounder, <b>or</b> you'll upset <b>the</b> boat. There now, get hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side, <b>and</b> let me use <b>the</b> paddle!”
<br>   With a few strokes Frodo brought <b>the</b> boat back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank. <b>and</b> Sam was able <b>to</b> scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> stepped ashore again.
<br>   “Of all <b>the</b> confounded nuisances you are <b>the</b> worst, Sam! “he said.
<br>   “Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard! “said Sam shivering. “That's hard, trying <b>to</b> go without me <b>and</b> all. If I hadn't a guessed right, where would you be now?”
<br>   “Safely <b>on</b> my way.”
<br>   “Safely! “said Sam. “All alone <b>and</b> without me <b>to</b> help you? I couldn't have a borne <b>it</b>, <b>it</b>'d have been <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> me.”
<br>   “It would be <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> you <b>to</b> come with me, Sam,” said Frodo <b>and</b> I could not have borne that.”
<br>   “Not as certain as being left behind,” said Sam.
<br>   “But I am going <b>to</b> Mordor.”
<br>   “I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you.”
<br>   “Now, Sam,” said Frodo, “don't hinder me! The others will be coming back at any minute. If they catch me here. I shall have <b>to</b> argue <b>and</b> explain, <b>and</b> I shall never have <b>the</b> heart <b>or</b> <b>the</b> chance <b>to</b> get off. But I must go at once. It's <b>the</b> only way.”
<br>   “Of course <b>it</b> is,” answered Sam. “But not alone. I'm coming too, <b>or</b> neither <b>of</b> us isn't going. I'll knock holes in all <b>the</b> boats first.”
<br>   Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth <b>and</b> gladness touched his heart. “Leave one! “he said. “We'll need <b>it</b>. But you can't come like this without your gear <b>or</b> food <b>or</b> anything.”
<br>   “Just hold <b>on</b> a moment, <b>and</b> I'll get my stuff!” cried Sam eagerly. “It's all ready. I thought we should be off today.” He rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camping place, fished out his pack from <b>the</b> pile where Frodo had laid <b>it</b> when he emptied <b>the</b> boat <b>of</b> his companions” goods grabbed a spare blanket, <b>and</b> some extra packages <b>of</b> food, <b>and</b> ran back.
<br>   “So all my plan is spoilt! “said Frodo. “It is <b>no</b> good trying <b>to</b> escape you. But I'm glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is plain that we were meant <b>to</b> go together. We will go, <b>and</b> may <b>the</b> others find a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them again.”
<br>   “Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,” said Sam.
<br>   So Frodo <b>and</b> Sam set off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quest together. Frodo paddled away from <b>the</b> shore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River bore them swiftly away. down <b>the</b> western arm, <b>and</b> past <b>the</b> frowning cliffs <b>of</b> Tol Brandir. The roar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, <b>it</b> was hard work <b>to</b> pass across <b>the</b> current at <b>the</b> southward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island <b>and</b> drive <b>the</b> boat eastward towards <b>the</b> far shore.
<br>   At length they came <b>to</b> land again upon <b>the</b> southern slopes <b>of</b> Amon Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, <b>and</b> they drew <b>the</b> boat out, high above <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> hid <b>it</b> as well as they could behind a great boulder. Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would bring them over <b>the</b> grey hills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil, <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Shadow.
<br>   
<br>   Here ends <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring.
<br>   
<br>   The second part is called The Two Towers, since <b>the</b> events recounted in <b>it</b> are dominated <b>by</b> Orthanc, <b>the</b> citadel <b>of</b> Saruman, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fortress <b>of</b> Minas Morgul that guards <b>the</b> secret entrance <b>to</b> Mordor; <b>it</b> tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeds <b>and</b> perils <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> now sundered fellowship, until <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Darkness.
<br>   The third part tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last defence against <b>the</b> Shadow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring-bearer in The Return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King.
<br>1 As <b>the</b> records <b>of</b> Gondor relate this was Argeleb II, <b>the</b> twentieth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern line, which came <b>to</b> an end with Arvedui three hundred years later.
<br>2 Thus, <b>the</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age in <b>the</b> reckoning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain may be found <b>by</b> adding 1600 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dates <b>of</b> Shire-reckoning.
